<div class="section" id="2024/03/03"> 2024/03/03 </div>
<p>I came back from a hike last week, looked at my scheduled for the following week and thought about how I've gotten shitty sleep, and said, "nah, self care this week looks like not spending 2 hours updating my blog."</p>
<p>I hadn't slept this poorly in a long time. It was a combination of work stress and my hot room that made my anxiety too much to handle, that made me wake up every hour to see if it's light out and if I needed to go to work. I knew I needed to make a conscious decision to prioritize my mental health. This week, with the long hours at work and insane class schedules, I decided to take it easy. And also I started swimming (moving my body in general makes me feel better) again as well. I'm happy to report that my sleep quality has indeed improved.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get into the pool. I'm glad I took the time, because at the beginning of the year, when I wanted to sign up for a swim team again, I did so thinking about the competitions I would be in, or the ripped back that I would gain once again. I didn't feel motivated to swim for external reasons, but the motivation coming from a place of acceptance and self-love had yet to take shape. When I realized I needed to swim to quell my anxiety, I thought this was the right moment. And I'm glad I went. I still am the slowest swimmer on the team, but I smiled when I swam, because I now swim to feel better about myself and know that I'm taking care of myself, rather than beating myself up for being slow and never making it at a competition. I'm there for the extra motivation to move, when I couldn't get myself to move. </p>
<p>The more I swam and went to choir, the more I notice the resemblance of this period in my life with my high school life. Richmond had a river, hills, churches, museums, coffee shops, restaurants, a few universities, and barely any Asians or Asian restaurants. I swam and sang in a choir every day. I have always liked choir, but in high school, I had the attitude that I was better than all of these other people in choir, and felt resentful that they were presented with opportuniteis for universities purely because they were white and grew up in Richmond. Their lives and mine were different from the start, and will continue to be, and for the period of time, when we were in the same physical space, I chose to distance myself. They would never understand the kind of pain and loneliness of being foreign that I had experienced, at age 16, alone in a foreign country, when they have lived on daddy's money their entire lives in the same place. I myself didn't understand the pain, the kind of grieving I was doing for myself: the price I had to pay to follow my instinct of being somewhere else meant giving up comfort, security, familiarity, and just because I've experienced it at age 5 does not make the loss feel any less painful at age 16. I was convinced: I was destined for bigger and better things that I could not yet name, and I'm to leave as soon as possible. </p>
 <p> I can't say I don't feel the same way right now about Turin, feeling like I should be somewhere else better, living a more glamorous life after an MBA, getting paid a better salary, being around the company of other successful 25 year olds. But I don't feel driven by the same things as I used to. I'm admitting to myself my weakness, my feelings of not being enough, my heartaches, my struggles, my limitations. I want to rest. I'm letting myself be comfortable, finding and making friends, seeking out the expat community, not wasting time with fake nice people and listening to racist comments. Maybe fundamentally, Turin and Richmond are not that different for me, since these are cities that will never claim me, or be claimed by me. But for a while, I just want to carve out space for myself in this place and feel at ease, and explore all that it has to offer. </p>


<div class="section" id="2024/02/18"> 2024/02/18 </div>
<p>Life is full of struggle as always. New topic of work for this week has been accepting all parts of myself, even the parts that I didn't like. It's amazing to see what has popped up. </p>
<p>Here are direct quotes from my journal entries:</p>
<p> <i>I can continue to imagine a reunion. Maybe another look at each other will show that we shouldn't have been together at all and accept our paths diverging, or see in each other's eyes that we are still as crazy as we were about ach other when we first met, but have gotten to know each other as different people. I don't want to rush the process. I don't want to confuse myself on what it is that I'm actually feeling.</i> </p>
<p><i>At what point will I realize and accept that it's less about how I wanted our story to end, but more about why I don't feel like I deserve to be treated better? Why do I acccept the bare minimum that people put into relationships? Do I treat my own relationship with myself with the bare minimum, and accept that I can't do better? What happens if I do something better? What kind of magic and fireworks will appear? What kind of reconciliation will I find? </i></p>
<p>I will also share what I wrote in the shadow work journal. I cried because I realized I had ignored those parts of myself.</p>
<p>What are you most proud of or what do you feel is your greatest accomplishment? <br>
- Surviving the rape and still be able to enjoy having sex, feel happy, adventurous, and open to new relationships</p>
<p>What do you believe this accomplishment means about you? [this is when I cried] </p>
<p> - That I've been here this entire time, that I never gave up on myself, that I've given myself a chance, day after day, to experience the world in a way that I've wanted to since the moment I was conceived. That no matter what happens in the future, I know I am here with me, to be with myself when times are hard. That I'm awesome, I'm a badass bitch, that I'm courageous and I try time and again and not lose faith in myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also want to take a few lines and share some of the fun things I've done in these past few days / weeks. I would like to eventually port these to my travel page, time permitting. </p>
<p>Feb 10th, Saturday: lunar new year party with Turin friends & special guests from Milan <br>
  Feb 5th, Monday: pizza & live jazz <br>
  Feb 11th, Sunday: Carnivale di Ivrea. I watched grown ass men throw oranges at each other for an entire afternoon in an medieval town. <br>
  Feb 16th, Friday: joined a coworking event. New friends shared "Baci" chocolate at the table, which have a wrapping with a cute sentence on it (yes think Italian fortune cookies). Mine was a quote from Luigi Pirandello: "And love looked at time and laughed, becuase it was of no difference."<br>
  Feb 17th, Saturday: went climbing outdoors at a local crag. Came back and enjoyed conversations with new expat friends at a local beer hall in the middle of an outdoor urban art museum in the historic town center. It's called MAU--Museo di Arte Urbana.<br>
  Feb 18th, Sunday: went to a contemporary art museum inside a castle called "Castello di Rivoli"

<div class="section" id="2024/02/11"> 2024/02/11 痛 </div>
<p>[TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
<p> I was in a lot of pain this week, possibly the most I had allowed myself to feel in my entire life.</p>
<p> Was the rape painful? I don't remember feeling the pain. I remember how hot the room felt from the heat on full blast, while my face was cold against the window, where I looked out into the street lights and lights from other houses, and silently screamed. Was there anyone who could hear me and come to take me out of the room? I watched myself being pinned down onto the bed. I watched myself stiffen and immediately give up when I realized it was a fight I was never going to win. I watched myself drift from fear to despair to nothingness. I stopped feeling, or even thinking that I was going to die. I watched my body being violated so that I could step out of the nightmare as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Was I in pain the months after the rape? I was depressed. I numbed myself with depression so I wouldn't feel the pain. I didn't know how else to stay alive, to face the anger of betraying myself, to face the guilt and blame of putting myself in that room.</p>
<p> Was I in pain when I got the phone call that the rapist could get away with no consequences and still graduate? I felt erased, like my reality wasn't real and my story didn't matter. I got back into the car and pretended that my reality really wasn't real and my story really didn't matter, and kept driving my parents along Highway 1 in California. I hadn't told them about the rape. How could I have trusted them to see my reality and believe in my story, when I failed to be the perfect, unraped daughter? </p>
<p> I romanticize my unraped life. If I had never been raped, I would have perfect emotional control like a normal person. My life would be filled with bliss, I wouldn't have to deal with depression, inconvenient outbursts of anger, anxiety, fear of abandonment, dread that I'm not enough.</p>
<p> How long was I going to pretend that rape is my only trauma? That I had emotionally available parents who taught me how to process my emotions and never abandoned me? </p>
<p> Growing up, my mom's go-to phrase to discpline me was "I have limited patience for you." The only acceptable feelings were happiness--which I was required to feel 100% of the time--and anger--something only my parents were entitled to. I never learned what any other emotions are. I was shamed for feeling homesick and wanted to come home from kindergarten--that was a sign of weakness. "Look at how none of the other kids asked for their parents the same way that you did." I was blamed when there were issues with my host family and they didn't feed me dinner. "Stop being ungrateful." Over the years, I got good at pretending and wearing a smile on my face and saying everything is fine when inside, there were a million ants eating at my heart.</p>
<p> How many more journal entries does it take before I stop writing "I'm so lucky to have met such a powerful, commanding, stoic man, and it's my opportunty to satisfy his sexual needs more"?</p>
<p> I don't want to keep pretending anymore. I want to rewrite my story. It takes pain to get there. </p>
<p> Pain is inconvenient. Pain is when Enrico says "no" to returning my backpack and having a last conversation before we speak ever again. Pain is realizing that the backpack was a power move to have Enrico say yes to me, that I didn't actually want him or the backpack. Pain is realizing I never processed the no that was ignored when my body was violated, and that I just wanted to ignore Enrico's "no". Pain is realizing that I want Enrico to feel what it's like to have his "no" ignored, something I had sworn I would not even do to my worst enemy, and the shock that I would impose it on someone that I had treasured beyond anything in the world. Pain is realizing that Enrico is treating me exactly how I had treated myself for the past 25 years: ignoring my own pain, ignoring my own no, ignoring my desire for connection with myself. Pain is realizing that I didn't accept myself.</p>
<p> Pain is overwhelming. It takes over all my senses. I suffer. I feel angry, sad, anxious. I want an empty room for myself to punch, scream, kick, power over, and destroy everything in my path. </p>
<p> Pain is exhausting. It makes me want to stay in bed and cry with Sealio (my stuffed animal seal). </p>
<p> Pain is fair. It is something everyone experiences, thought unique in its origin and the way it's inflicted. I'm never alone in pain. </p>
<p> In Chinese, the word that means "pain" is composed of two characters: hurt 痛 and suffering 苦. Pain isn't just feeling hurt. Pain is the suffering from feeling hurt. </p>
<p> Pain doesn't go away on its own. Just like physical pain, if the root cause is not identified, or if it's ignored or buried, it accumulates to something truly out of control. Pain needs to be dissected, biopsied, studied, acknowledged, described, accepted, before it can be healed. </p>
<p> Pain is not permanent. It passes eventually. When it does, it leaves some more space in the cluttered room of my heart. It's space where I can hold more emotions with kindness and acceptance. Just like the piercings that I got last year: when the wounds healed, I got to put gems and shiny things in them. </p>
<p> A new friend I met in Torino said: the suffering we feel, when we recover from them, becomes an opportunity for us to help other people grow. </p>
<p> Pain has been a humbling experience for me to realize there are limited things I can do to help myself, and I don't dare to imagine that wars and famine around the world will cease because of my ability to process my own pain into something beautiful. I'm not obsessed with making the world a better place anymore, because I realize there are so few things I can do. </p>
<p> But maybe, just maybe, this will turn into something beautiful. Pain thrived in my mind obsessed with romanticizing the life that is "somewhere else, better, full of bliss, perfect." It does not exist. It's a painful realization, but I cannot look away any longer, because all I can do is to take one moment at a time, one day at a time, until the pain gets better. Pain is teaching me to stay in the present, the here and now, to feel its full depth, because now is the only reality we will ever have.</p>

  <div class="section" id="2024/02/04"> 2024/02/04 初见 </div>
  <p>I cried almost every day this week, even when days are getting easier and easier. I wailed and kicked my sheets one night in bed as a toddler would . Those weren't just tears for me. Those were tears that my younger self wished she was allowed to cry, when she wasn't picked up again. As I discovered this week during therapy, all she really wanted was for someone to hold her hand and go get egg tarts together. I have a vague memory, from the year before I went to boarding kindergarten, where my mom would take me to the People's Square metro station (which is like an underground mall in and of itself), and somehow egg tarts were involved, but I have no memory of what the place looks like. I just remember the smell of the egg tarts, the creamy filling inside, and the crusty pastry supporting the yummy middle. That's why every time I walk past an egg tart shop now, I buy one. Those were happy memories of being with my mother. </p>
  <p>One night, as I was walking home, I thought again about how I would be alone when I went home. But instead of feeling desperately lonely and sad, I saw myself--my identity--just floating in a dark space, the universe, and realized that maybe I really am truly alone. No matter how many people I know and how many friend I make in this life, I am alone in my own brain, floating in the universe. It was a powerful moment of connection with the universe, becuase instead of just feeling connected to the night sky and the stars above, I felt connected to the three dimensional space around me. If I had continued studying math, I would have chosen to study the shape of the universe in a heartbeat. (someone quote this sentence when I get a PhD please) </p>
  <p>I'm terrified of loneliness. I'm even more terrified of realizing I'm alone this entire time. My biggest fear is to have the world closing in on me, and as I back into a wall, I look back and discover there is nothing there. This is exactly what happened when Enrico disappeared on me. I will continue to be paralyzed by fear unless I learn to sit with my emotions, now that I've had my worst nightmware realized. I can try to hide it, numb myself with over stretching my social bandwidth or downloading bumble, all in an effort to convince myself that I'm likeable and socialable and lovable. But I know this is exactly what fear feeds on, the fake happiness, and it will haunt me forever. Out of a desire to reconcile with myself, I want to learn to sit with myself.</p>
  <p>I told my therapist that sitting with my younger self at times felt like pure torture, that I was in so much pain that I didn't know what to do. I really dislike not being in control, especially when it involves pain, and I can't "do" my way to "normal". I know the pain is a part of the process, and I wanted motivation to not numb myself. Instead of giving me motivation, he asked me what my 5 year old self would say to me when she sees that I show up. My knee jerk reaction was, "why the fuck did it take you 20 years to come here," but if I listen closer, I don't hear it coming from my 5 year old self. My 5 year old self is totally chill, unconditionally accepts me for who I am, and is just happy to see me because someone will holder her hand now. The moment she sees me, she is off to the grandest adventure: looking at a daddy long leg crossing the forest floor, taking a nap under the whispering leaves, jumping up and down rocks because she has endless energy. I'd choose to hang out with her any second of the day. Who gives a fuck how many degrees I have, what career advancements I've made, what impressive things I've said or done. She is the person who would take me in no matter how beat up and disheveled I am from the grind of the outside world. </p>
  <p>I have asked every possible friend with time and ears (thank you for listening) what they thought about being alone. The answers were inspiring. There's an idiom in Chinese about bachelor(ette)s: if one person is full, the entire family is full (一人吃饱，全家不饿). I knew it was what people said, but I didn't know what it meant in practice, until one wise friend said, "think about how much thought you're putting into what to text Enrico." I had noticed that this thought had taken up a lot of my headspace, and I often felt resentful that I had to put in the effort, but the beauty of my friend's comment was making me realize that I had a choice in what to do with my thought. It's a choice I'm making in how I want to show up for other people. It shouldn't be based on merely expecting the other person to do it in return, becuase then my intentions aren't pure, and I really could just take out the middle step of "wanting empathy from another person" and replace it with "I want to empathize with myself." I want to be the person who listens to others and empathize with them, because it's something that has helped me grow tremendously over the last few years, but more imporantly now, I want to show myself that I can empathize with myself first. (also another underlying reason is I felt like I was such a shitty person to my friends in middle school becase I hadn't learned how to speak in a way that was considerate of their feelings, and I really hurt their feelings at the time, and I have to make up for it now by doing extra.) Another friend came in with a hot take today: words are just words. When I asked him why, he gave an example: think of something really mean that was said to you that you could not recover from. I actually spent a solid minute thinking, and I did think of some mean things that people have said to me, and I realized my friend was right, I recovered from those, because words are just words, and other people's words don't define me. I define me.</p>
  <p> I had always thought that words are more than words, because you can build bridges and burn bridges, create understanding and misunderstandings, and I followed the mantra of "people won't remember what you said, but they will remember what you made them feel" almost religiously. Maybe the truth lies somehwere in between (quote from another wise friend). </p>




  <div class="section" id="2024/01/28"> 2024/01/28 岁月静好 </div>
  <p>I finally feel alive again. I'm back to my normal workload, which explains why I feel so exhausted every night. I'm grateful for the chance to sleep soundly. </p>
  <p>To give you an idea of what I did this week: 2 therapy sessions, climbing, choir, calling friends, climbing outdoors, meanwhile working a 40 hour week, and cooking, eating, cleaning, journaling, reflecting, calling my parents. Apparently, I numb myself using work. Considering that I don't do drugs or alcohol, I take this as an acceptable for of numbing. Anxiety is fine when I can keep myself alive. </p>
  <p>Now that I am in a safe place, and I'm starting to put different pieces of my life in order, I wonder if I want to give this restlessness reign over my life like I used to. My therapist pointed out that I was judging myself for feeling lazy the week before, when I didn't "do much." In reality, I did tremendous amount of work, taking one day at a time, being with myself as time slowed down to the point where miliseconds felt like hours.</p>
  <p>It's no news that I have a hard time giving credit to myself. I've lived like this all my life. I "do" my way through tough situations to avoid "feel." Though I don't explicitly remember this, I can easily imagine my 5-year-old self thinking, "if I were good enough, my mom would come pick me up today." (For those of you who don't know, I went to boarding kindergarten for a year. I did not enjoy it as much as my parents told themselves I did. It's a can of worms we carefully avoid going near as a family.) Then I guess it also makes sense that I go for emotionally unavailable people, because I can avoid dealing with my own emotions, trying to prove my worth by winning affection that would never come, and putting myself in the familiar situation of emotional neglect. I don't have much, but in the situation, at least I have something that I know with certainty. </p>
  <p>I don't want to live like this anymore. I hope neuroplasticity will kick into high gear and help me get through this behavior pattern. My therapist laughed (in the kindest way) when I said this. This is not an intellectual exercise. I have to feel, to be, to live with my heart. It takes more time and energy than I expect. Peace cannot be "found." I have to create my own peace. </p>
  <p> Maybe I can give myself more credit for taking care of myself. I'm starting to get a bit obsessed with the idea of holding space for myself. I noticed it because my therapist makes me want to discover parts of my brain and my heart that I would not even show the people closest to me, the parts that often I don't even know I'm hiding. Something that I started doing today (let's see how long it lasts): every time I think about Enrico, I have to ask myself why I feel like I have the urge to talk and text him. Aside from wanting to share my life with someone I like, I've disocvered that I actually want to be seen and acknowledged for the things I'm doing for myself. It feels like a roundabout way of going about holding space, but so far I have learned a lot about what emotions are present. </p>
  <p>I didn't make it 21 days of not texting Enrico. I texted him earlier in the week, and we ended up having a conversation. He said he'll just listen and not talk about himself or us. Even then, he kept trying to tell me what to do. Funny how I never noticed these things before, like how I had to be so careful with wording when texting him. This was the closure I needed. I asked him if he missed me. He said sometimes he thinks about me. Voila, how different that I think about him all the time. Memories of him and expectations of what he should do are like the splinters from the chestnuts that I got from bushwhacking yesterday. They go unnoticed when they first enter and while I was having fun, but back after a shower and a day they are festering under my skin, and the pain makes it impossible to stop thinking about them. I don't know how I'll ever have the courage to let someone into my world again, if these are the consequences. </p>
  <p>But Valentine's day is around the corner. I think I'm scared every year if I have to spend that day alone. Friday, while on my way to pick up a crashpad for climbing the next day, I saw a couple walking, and the girl had flowers. I got emotional, with such a strong feeling that I couldn't name. I really wanted to be next to the person that would buy me flowers every week and take me out to dinner every week. Someone to celebrate the small and big moments of life with, eat egg tarts with, go all over the world with. Someone who would make me food. Someone who thinks I'm the most special person in the world, and wouldn't do anything to make me sacrifice what I love or betray myself. I started crying, and at first I thought they were tears of sadness that this person wasn't here, but then realized maybe those were happy tears -- happy that I had this vision. Maybe those were tears of longing, longing for a romance so romantic that even Jane Austen could not pen it. I remembered what one of my high school librarians shared with me. In the hazy and foggy dawn, her husband would pick a fresh magnolia flower from their garden, in full bloom in May (Richmond VA weather), put it into a bowl with water, and bring it into their bedroom so that the smell would fill the room when she wakes up. </p>
  <p>Maybe I have to accept that I will be completely alone on Valentine's day, but I have memories of romantic things that people have told me, and imagine even more romantic things that my future partner will do for me, whilst taking care of myself. Last year, I was at a concert with friends, a very peaceful classical music concert. I drifted into sleep because it was so peaceful and I was so sleep deprived from preparing for three different competitions, doing onsite interviews, traveling, and hooking up with random guys. There were guys that were harder to let go of than others, but I did it anyway. Maybe being alone on Valentine's day isn't the worst experience ever :)</p>


  <div class="section" id="2024/01/21">2024/01/21 </div>
  <p>  If last week was surviving a trial given by the sky (劫后余生), then this week is awakening from a slumber (如梦初醒).</p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and realized that I can reach out to friends and family and admit that my trauma is more than I know how to deal with. The important ones stayed and listened and offered support. I shared with friends what I had written on this page, and they texted me things like "It's okay to open yourself up to love and ask for what you need." "I'm always here for you." I asked friends if they would be willing to be on my safety plan, they said yes without questions and told me times when they know they cannot be avaialble, and checked to see if I was ok with that. I asked friends to help me find emergency numbers in Italy, and help me translate what I need to say in Italian. This brings me warm and fuzzy feelings, like I can curl up in my bed, and my bed is the softest and plushiest bed in the whole world, and that even if far away, friends and family are there for me. I called my mom on average for an hour a day, which never happened since I moved away from home. This is how I wished I could call her when I was little, and I'm surprised that now she answers every time and listens every time, instead of telling me to be strong until she picks me up.  </p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and learned that self-love is love too. Taking it one day at a time was really all that I could do. Looking back, I liked waking up each day and realizing today felt better than yesterday, even if the moment between slumber and wakefulness made me doubt it. When I got out of bed and put clothes on, I knew I was in a different stage. My biggest complaint to myself this week was how my food tasted like shit compared to what I can usually cook, and I could not help but think, love really is my magic ingredient that makes food taste good. Later this week, I realized I can decide to make my food taste good with the love I have for myself. I also noticed how I have a hard time accepting myself for my trauma. I still wish it never happened. I feel broken, I feel like I can never be perfect, I feel like I will forever be despised. No one is telling me any of those things. I am working on reconciling with myself, accepting that I can be imperfect, that I make mistakes, that there are hurdles that I fall when I first try to cross. I won't give up trying to be the best I can. I also won't give up trying to let go and make peace with myself. </p>
  <p>I woke up from the dream of wanting someone to love me. This entire time, 5 months in total, I had lied to myself that if I tried hard enough to be the perfect girlfriend material, Enrico would like me back and care for me the way I needed to be cared for. I ignored every single red flag waving in my face, and thought that relationships are about compromises, and these are the things I have to accept to continue seeing him. I can go on about the terrible things he did in the relationship and postulate all the possibility of silence during a time when I most needed support, but that would not bring me peace. I just wish I can stop thinking about him, once and for all. The awakening came when I realized I am free forever from his expectation of me. </p>
    <p>I am doing a nightly check in of "I didn't text him today" with a friend of mine. I need to hold myself accountable and remember what his actions mean. Herewith I present the wise words of my friend:
      <br>"You can't trust him when he's not there for you when you need him the most"
      <br>"You deserve so much better than what he can offer"
      <br>"It's easy to forget the bad things when you really like someone"
      <br>"What a selfish prick"
      <br>"You can find someone much much better trust me"
      <br> We are at day 5 now. I heard it takes 21 days to build a habit. I'm learning to give up the hope that magically, one day, his text of "sorry I wasn't there for you, I want to make things right" will arrive in my inbox. I don't need to give myself hope and let myself down again. I feel liberated that I don't have to be his provider of sex or free apartment when he visits. I believe my friend when she says I can do much better.
  </p>
  <p>I dreamed my frist good dream the other night, a dream I wish I never had to wake up from. I met someone through an acquaintance, and the first time we spoke, we could not stop talking to each other. The way he looked into my eyes, he saw my soul. He looked at me with love, with desire, but not the kind where he wanted to have sex with me. He saw me completely. He had long blond hair. His cheeks are smooth when we kissed. He told me he loved me. When he asked if I wanted to be with him, I hesitated. That's when I knew my concsious brain kicked in. I have turned down every single person who told me they liked me. I thought it was a burden to be with them, because they will immediately withdraw when they find out I'm not the perfect self that they thought I was, or that they would follow me around incessantly and have no actual identity. Never once did I entertain the possibility where the other person was as interesting as me, as supportive as me, as courageous and adventurous and strong and weak and imperfect as me. I wish that was a dream that played out longer, that I had figured out in my dream how to find this person. I guess this is where my concious brain needs to do the work. How to do it, I don't know. May my favorite lines from Bob Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man bid good omen to this endeavour:
  <br> And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
  <br> Down the foggy ruins of time
  <br> Far past the frozen leaves
  <br> The haunted frightened trees
  <br> Out to the windy beach
  <br> Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
  <br> Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
  <br> With one hand waving free
  <br> Silhouetted by the sea
  <br> Circled by the circus sands
  <br> With all memory and fate
  <br> Driven deep beneath the waves
  <br> Let me forget about today until tomorrow</p>
  <p> I am learning to hold space for my emotions. I am learning to be alone and not feel lonely. I'm starting to feel excited for the coming week and the things that I can do to bring joy. </p>
  <p>Oh and if you are the person that I'm meant to be with, even if you are not a dude, don't have blond hair and smooth cheeks, please still tell me you are you :)</p>

  <p>[TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
  <p>This weekend was eventful and dynamic. And to think, this is weekend #2 of 2024. <br>
  I met old friends in Milan yesterday, many of whom are starting new lives. I didn't realize how much I cherished those friendship until I was in their presence again. They have supported me since I first moved to Italy, friendless and unable to speak Italian. They were within the first 100 people I had interacted with. They are open, genuine, honest souls, and have been since the beginning. The older I get, the more I realize those qualities are hard to come by. And to see so many of them in a day, what a lucky person I am.</p>
  <p>Simultaneosuly, there were many challenging moments. I got furious and said mean things to Enrico, and I'm scared we will never speak again. I cried to my mom for two hours. I had a mental breakdown after I came back from a run. Sometimes, things pile up, and emotions get swept under the rug as I go from one checklist to another. The momentary rush of dopamine that comes from completing yet another document in <i>Italy</i> makes me feel invincible, and I forget about the shit I just had to deal with to get here.</p>
  <p> I realized I had more than just PMS to deal with when I started hearing voices in my head again. These voices have been dormant for the last year, thanks to a change of scenery and commitment to thearpy, but today, they unleashed themselves into my brain like the floodgates of hell have been left loose. </p>
    "No one cares about you" <br>
    "You're not worth living" <br>
    "People are better off without you" <br>
    "You're not worthy of love" <br>
    "Why didn't you jump in front of the train yesterday" <br>

  <p> I didn't have enough calm to get the negative self talk to stop, but I had enough awareness to realize this felt like the same mental space I was in during the darkest months of my depression after the rape. I knew I was triggered. It must have been what happened this week. The gynocology exam on Tuesday still gives me shivers, the two gas technicians in my home on Friday increased the feeling of having my space invaded, and the incompetent geometra reminded me of the policemen who looked like they diligently took notes but did jackshit for the investigation.
  </p>

  <p> I noticed myself hyperventilating: in my mind, I started going through all the things I could do to take my own life. I was almost excited for the relief of the voices in my head as a result. (Yes, I had just met people that I love and care about me the day before, and talked to people I love and care about me just 3 hours ago.) </p>
  <p> Something told me that was not a wise thing to do. I emailed my therapist to move up our therapy session to his first availability. I thought back to the emergency plan that I had made years ago, and realized my contacts are out of date. I wanted to reach out to one friend, but felt silly because just last week when we talked, I had shared all the things I was excited for and looking forward to in the new year in a new city, then felt silly for feeling silly. Call it instinct, or my guardian angel whispering in my ear, I ended up texting a friend whom I've openly shared about my depression and discussed mental health.
  <p>
    [Do you have time right now]<br>
    [I'm not doing well]<br>
    [I don't know who to call for help right now]<br>
  </p>
      <p>[Yes you can call me]  </p>

      <p>I was too embarrassed to admit that I wanted to hurt myself. I started crying when I thanked him for picking up. But he didn't ask what was going on.</p>

      "Do you have a glass of water" <br>
      "Ok pour yourself some" <br>
      "Take small sips"<br>
      "Now breathe wth me"<br>
      "I'm here with you"<br>
      "One breath in, hold it for a little bit, then breathe out"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath longer"<br>
      "Remember to breathe out too"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath for 3 seconds"<br>
      "Do you want to talk about what's happening, or do you want to just talk about random things"<br>

      <p> He held space for me, and that helped me help myself. I didn't do something that would take away tomorrow's sunrise from me forever. </p>

        <p> I told him I was triggered, and that I was scared to be raped again, because I know there was no way I can survive it again.
        <br> "You will. It'll be hard, but you will find a way."
        <br>I knew he was right. There was hope, and I forgot about it, but he reminded me that I've done hard things before, and that I can do it again.

        <p> I told him I don't want to be haunted by my demons anymore.
          <br> "You don't have to be. You don't have to let them. Don't let your past define you. Don't try to fight them or push them away, because they will come at you in the most unexpected moments, and then you have to deal with many difficult things all at once. Instead, learn to live with them. It's easier when you do that." Even if it takes discpline and practice to do that, I knew he was right. </p>

        <p> My eyes are still puffy and sore from the three hours of tears that I cried. I didn't realize I still had that much tears. I think at some point the tears turned into tears of happiness, that despite the challenges I'm still alive, and there are people around me who will hold space for me in tough moments. I am counting my blessings, and I have counted them to be exactly the number of tears I have shed. </p>

        <p> Recovery from trauma is not linear. 5 years later and I am still actively dealing with it, but this time surrounded by people I love and living the life that I chose. I wanted to share this moment with you, because maybe it will spread and help another trauma survivor remember that we are not alone, even if it feels like it. If you don't have a friend to call, let my friend's words help you grab a glass of water, slow down your quick and shallow breaths, and remember that we are not our demons.</p>
