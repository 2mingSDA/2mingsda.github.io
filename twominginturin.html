  [TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
  <p>This weekend was eventful and dynamic. And to think, this is weekend #2 of 2024. <br>
  I met old friends in Milan yesterday, many of whom are starting new lives. I didn't realize how much I cherished those friendship until I was in their presence again. They have supported me since I first moved to Italy, friendless and unable to speak Italian. They were within the first 100 people I had interacted with. They are open, genuine, honest souls, and have been since the beginning. The older I get, the more I realize those qualities are hard to come by. And to see so many of them in a day, what a lucky person I am.</p>
  <p>Simultaneosuly, there were many challenging moments. I got furious and said mean things to someone I really care about, and I'm scared we will never speak again. I cried to my mom for two hours. I had a mental breakdown after I came back from a run. Sometimes, things pile up, and emotions get swept under the rug as I go from one checklist to another. The momentary rush of dopamine that comes from completing yet another document in <i>Italy</i> makes me feel invincible, and I forget about the shit I just had to deal with to get here.</p>
  <p> I realized I had more than just PMS to deal with when I started hearing voices in my head again. These voices have been dormant for the last year, thanks to a change of scenery and commitment to thearpy, but today, they unleashed themselves into my brain like the floodgates of hell have been left loose. </p>
    "No one cares about you" <br>
    "You're not worth living" <br>
    "People are better off without you" <br>
    "You're not worthy of love" <br>
    "Why didn't you jump in front of the train yesterday" <br>

  <p> I didn't have enough calm to get the negative self talk to stop, but I had enough awareness to realize this felt like the same mental space I was in during the darkest months of my depression after the rape. I knew I was triggered. It must have been what happened this week. The gynocology exam on Tuesday still gives me shivers, the two gas technicians in my home on Friday increased the feeling of having my space invaded, and the incompetent geometra reminded me of the policemen who looked like they diligently took notes but did jackshit for the investigation.
  </p>

  <p> I noticed myself hyperventilating: in my mind, I started going through all the things I could do to take my own life. I was almost excited for the relief of the voices in my head as a result. (Yes, I had just met people that I love and care about me the day before, and talked to people I love and care about me just 3 hours ago.) </p>
  <p> Something told me that was not a wise thing to do. I emailed my therapist to move up our therapy session to his first availability. I thought back to the emergency plan that I had made years ago, and realized my contacts are out of date. I wanted to reach out to one friend, but felt silly because just last week when we talked, I had shared all the things I was excited for and looking forward to in the new year in a new city, then felt silly for feeling silly. Call it instinct, or my guardian angel whispering in my ear, I ended up texting a friend whom I've openly shared about my depression and discussed mental health.
  <p>
    [Do you have time right now]<br>
    [I'm not doing well]<br>
    [I don't know who to call for help right now]<br>
  </p>
      <p>[Yes you can call me]  </p>

      <p>I was too embarrassed to admit that I wanted to hurt myself. I started crying when I thanked him for picking up. But he didn't ask what was going on.</p>

      "Do you have a glass of water" <br>
      "Ok pour yourself some" <br>
      "Take small sips"<br>
      "Now breathe wth me"<br>
      "I'm here with you"<br>
      "One breath in, hold it for a little bit, then breathe out"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath longer"<br>
      "Remember to breathe out too"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath for 3 seconds"<br>
      "Do you want to talk about what's happening, or do you want to just talk about random things"<br>

      <p> He held space for me, and that helped me help myself. I didn't do something that would take away tomorrow's sunrise from me forever. </p>

        <p> I told him I was triggered, and that I was scared to be raped again, because I know there was no way I can survive it again.
        <br> "You will. It'll be hard, but you will find a way."
        <br>I knew he was right. There was hope, and I forgot about it, but he reminded me that I've done hard things before, and that I can do it again.

        <p> I told him I don't want to be haunted by my demons anymore.
          <br> "You don't have to be. You don't have to let them. Don't let your past define you. Don't try to fight them or push them away, because they will come at you in the most unexpected moments, and then you have to deal with many difficult things all at once. Instead, learn to live with them. It's easier when you do that." Even if it takes discpline and practice to do that, I knew he was right. </p>

        <p> My eyes are still puffy and sore from the three hours of tears that I cried. I didn't realize I still had that much tears. I think at some point the tears turned into tears of happiness, that despite the challenges I'm still alive, and there are people around me who will hold space for me in tough moments. I am counting my blessings, and I have counted them to be exactly the number of tears I have shed. </p>

        <p> Recovery from trauma is not linear. 5 years later and I am still actively dealing with it, but this time surrounded by people I love and living the life that I chose. I wanted to share this moment with you, because maybe it will spread and help another trauma survivor remember that we are not alone, even if it feels like it. If you don't have a friend to call, let my friend's words help you grab a glass of water, slow down your quick and shallow breaths, and remember that we are not our demons.</p>
