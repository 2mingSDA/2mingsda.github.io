<p>I'm exhausted yet unable to sleep. </p>
<p>The last two weeks have been an emotional hurricane. Nothing happened out of the ordinary, and yet it feels like so much time has passed, on another dimension that I have access to but cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>The triggers and struggles are always there. Some things I didn't choose, like the creepy old man who lives in my building and touched my face. Some things I did choose, like throwing myself into a country that I don't speak the language of. In a moment of violation, I default to freeze, unable to formulate "please don't touch me." Unable to do it in English, or in Chinese, I would imagine, as this is purely a conditioned response from years of repression and fitting the mold of a good girl, a polite foreigner. There was no place to hide. And despite the unsolicited attention, I feel deeply invisible. My boundaries are ignored, my history reduced to a label, a novelty, "are you Japanese or Chinese." My wants, desires, longing, all refused. The power of being invisible and visible at the same time, strutting two places at ones, is the core of the expat identity. I'm always treated with double standards, but that means I also don't have to play by the rules. It's unfair, but an opportunity nontheless. I knew this the minute I left my home country, and I'm still coming to terms with it.</p>
<p>I feel parts of myself shutting down. Last Saturday, I spoke with no one, not even via text. I felt too disoriented to do anything. And yet not lonely. As a recovering FOMO, this is a significant milestone, not least triggered by an equally significant therapy session that will be quoted, henceforth, until eternity, by my very own lovely therapist. </p>
<p>I don't trust my therapist.</p>
<p>I don't remember how the conversation happened. I don't even remember what we were talking about, probably me venting about how unfair the world is to women. And like many times before, my therapist brings up the topic of entrusting another person with the experience in order to be seen. But somehow our conversation took a turn, and instead of just brushing over the default assumption, he paused, and asked, "do you trust me?" </p>
<p>It's as if time slowed down to a halt, and I saw every single possible answer in front of me, but the options were so many that I was immediately overwhelmed. Within an instant, my therapist said, "don't think, do you trust me?" I didn't have time to react and be polite and think through what to say. I didn't want to. I was backed into a corner, and before I knew it, I said, "no."</p>
<p>Part of me smiled, the edgy teenager, the Will Hunting when he was tormenting one therapist after another with fake cooperation. Or maybe the two year old, seeing a beautiful sand castle or toy castle, and giggling from pushing everything over. Another part of me stood in fear, fear of letting someone down, fear thinking that there's something wrong with me that I couldn't trust my therapist. There's certainly the incredulous part, of "oh no what did you just do, why did you say something hurtful." Yet another part of me felt relief, relief that finally, I don't have to pretend like I trust someone when I don't.</p>
<p>And who exactly do I trust in this world, if I don't even trust my therapist?</p>
<p>And if I don't trust my therapist, what's the whole point of therapy?</p>
<p>I felt naked when my therapist started connecting the dots, of feeling like I'm using therapy as a vaccine against depression(See 2024/09/15 entry), of feeling distance with myself and the world, of feeling stuck and not knowing why therapy feels like it's not going anywhere, of feeling so alone with my hurt and not knowing how to open my heart to let some light in. I needed the insight, but I felt embarassed. I was furious. </p>
<p>"How can you understand what I've been through if you've never been through the same thing?"</p>
<p>"You've never asked"</p>
<p>I never considered that anyone would understand me, see me, see all that it took to pull myself out of the bottom of an endless pit that I keep sinking back into. But now I see a whole army of us, like zombies, walking on this bith of an earth, silently holding vigil for each other, each dealing with this pain in our own ways.</p>
<p>Humanity is fucked up. Thanks to this universal truth, it means I can always find someone who's been through my kind of pain, no matter how unthinkable the circumstances. I have a heart. I have a human heart. No matter the numbing, the pain won't go away. It's a reminder of my humanity and fragility. But it's also a sign of strength, that I am still here. Simultaneously, I feel like I have a hole in me, where my heart should be. Through the hole, you can see the other side of the world, the good, the bad, the ugly, the beatiful sunrises, the wars, the hatred, the hopelessness, the loneliness. I feel trapped in this body, in this hole, and I'm scared I want to be in this hole. Is the hole just the pain I feel for being human?</p>
<p>I have mountains after mountains of grief built up within me. It's my job now to mourn, to profess, to speak of the pain. No wonder I feel parts of my shutting down--it is exhausting to mourn. I do some of it intuitively already, like journaling and writing this series, but it does feel a bit silly looking back, because I wrote so much about love without even knowing what it is. It feels silly and insignificant, even though I know I gave it my best effort to process whatever that was going on in that moment. But the longing is real. And maybe love is worth being silly over, because there are so many different kinds of love out there. </p>
<p>Here's to looking for love within ourselves, so that we can find love for humanity.</p>
<p></p>


<div class="section" id="2024/10/14"> 2024/10/14 </div>
<p>Time flies when you're having fun. Time also flies when you clean the house. Who knew I had accumulated so many posessions, that in turn accumulated so much dust? </p>
<p>I'm a firm believer that someone's living quarters is a reflection of their inner world. When I first moved to Turin, the last thing I wanted was to add more furniture to my apartment. I felt overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I had to carry from Milan--where did all this stuff come from, after just 15 months in Milan? With my one way ticket from Boston to Milan, I had two checked luggages and one carry on bag. I left everything else behind, thinking I had left behind my demons and extra baggages too. Turns out they were lurking at every corner, and no matter how much I tried to avoid them or pretended they didn't exist anymore, they'd come around in the most unsuspecting moments. They followed me to Turin, and knocked on my door at the most inconvenient times, leaving me sobbing in bed. I had nothing left to give to life, besides just watching my demons taunt and torment me. My apartment felt as empty as my heart. Many friendships and ten months later, a friend remarked that my place feels less empty than before. Maybe it was the beanbag that I conveniently placed in the dining area to make it seem more full, but the total number of things in the house increased minimally. Maybe the magic ingredient is all the work that I put in to take care of my own heart. </p>
<p>I know it's far from perfect. I'm a serial compartmentalizer: what I cannot deal with in the moment, I hide it. Out of sight, out of mind. Just like my house: all the visible mess are manageable within 15 minutes of picking things up and vaccuuming, it's the boxes inside bigger boxes inside my closet that holds secret upon secret. I have two closets: the one on my right contains all of my clean clothes and bedsheets. Cleaning those up was easy, and organizing everything actually left more space. The one on the left has my suitcases, camping gear (and by extension travel bags), and all of my boxes of souvenirs and memories (postcards, trinkets, maps, a Kraft Heinz ketchup bottle with my name on it). When I opened my left closet door, I felt overwhelmed. It was a metaphor for the part of my identity that I carefully packed away and never show people (obviously none of my friends would know the layout of my closet and what I would put where). It represents what I left behind, what I had to rebuild, and will continue wrestling with for as long as I am an expat. It has memories of Tyler, the cards and messages he wrote me, and the young love we had that we thought was the end all be all. It has memories of Enrico, the scrap book that I started making that was supposed to contain the story for the two of us and ended with many empty pages. </p>
<p>I don't even dare think I can fall in love with anyone again. Love felt so easy when I was younger; I just needed to try hard enough and become a better version of myself. Now that I've been through what I've been through (knowing full well this represents but a speck of dust in the whole spectrum of possible love experiences), I know love is more about having the courage to be myself, at the risk of not being loved. It's uncomfortable to have that courage, because it means not being liked by everyone. I hate it, so I fight it, and I always lose. </p>
<p>My therapist left me with another imagery this week. I was telling him about my phase of questioning my atheism. "What if there is something?" I asked, and instead of giving me an answer, he said "I see your fear, and it's like a fist, closed, holding something tight. What if you opened your palm? What is there?" </p>
<p>I saw light coming out of my palm. It was a deep longing for connection. It humbles me every time I realize it, because admitting it means I suffer the risk of not having it met. I'm trying to not fight it, and to catch it with my open palms this time. </p>

<div class="section" id="2024/10/07"> 2024/10/07 </div>
<p> It seems that no matter how much time I factor for writing, I always take longer than expected and wind up a night owl before having to wake up early for work. But at least I'm still writing. </p>
<p> My week ended in a messy <a href = "travel.html#2024/10/04"> Prague</a> trip, but luckily I am on the mend after a weekend staying in Turin and climbing with friends (ironic because I'm really thinking about quitting climbing, but don't worry it's to make room for other passions). It started out with an equally messy dream: "working with a girl, but doesn't matter where I go -- coffee, book shop -- it's the same girl working everywhere." Ouch. This is my spirit telling me that I'm actively trying to do everything under the sun by myself. And I'm glad to be listening to it: I'm staying put in Turin. I don't want to travel. I want to settle down and grow. </p>
<p> There's a lot to grow on. I want to stay put and build a routine so that I have energy to face the other things that surface. Not just the usual, existential, facing my demons that I've been running away from all my life. One never knows when a friend is going to share their being a victim of sexual abuse. One never knows when therapy session is going to turn into reliving the moments of the rape. One never knows when prescient dreams will make you wake up at 3am and feel compelled to journal. I want to save my time and mental space for moments like this, where life throws a "will you accept this side quest." </p>
<p> I felt destroyed leaving my therapy session. Insights come at a cost. My therapist explained boundaries using an analogy of fences and windows: for the average person, there is a fence between the self and the outside world, and there is a window between the self and the inner self for self awareness. When it comes to me, my fence and my window are swapped. The entire world can see through me, but I have a fence between me and my inner self, with no knowledge of what's going on inside. </p>
<p> I don't know if this is a chicken-vs-egg situation. Did my childhood, my culture, my gender, make me more susceptible to being manipulated? I wouldn't doubt it. Did rape completely throw my world upside down and obliterate any sense of orientation? Absolutely. I knew a part of me died that night. I don't know where it went, and I don't know if it will ever come back. </p>
<p> I knew being a woman meant experiencing irreversible (and borderline traumatizing) changes to my body: getting my first period meant I will bleed for a quarter of my life for the next 30 years (7.5 years of bleeding, think about that), losing my virginity meant the flesh covering my vagina being torn open to bleed, giving birth meant I will extrude another being, with blood, with flesh, with sweat and tears. Where does rape stand in all of this? I cannot figure out what it says about my femininity. Did I bleed that night? Not physically. My heart feels bruised and drowning in my own blood. </p>
<p> I must have been watching Esther Perel's TED talk the other day when I heard her say, "any sort of trauma heals from the perpetrator admitting wrong doing." In the context of a cheating partner, no doubt. In the context of a rape? I'm sorry, how the fuck am I ever going to get this? Write a letter? Knock on his door? Take him to court? I tried forgiveness. I tried acceptance. I guess I have to be more creative in trying different things to heal. </p>
<p> I've long given up hope that life will ever go back to "normal." I'm still learning to give up the idea of the romanticized, unraped life. And I've learned to look for peace. There's not much more I can ask for in this life. Love is a luxury, something I don't know if I will ever experience again.</p>
<p> Part of the reason why I felt I really needed to go to Prague had to do with Abe. I wasn't even thinking about him when I booked the trip, but as the dates neared, I thought to myself, what if, just what if, his number is actually still up and running? </p>
<p> Who is Abe, you ask? </p>
<p> Our story started in 2017. We met for the first time at the end of freshmen year. It was a bright summer morning, certainly the end of May, when I sat outside my dorm, and saw him slacklining on the shared lawn between his dorm and my dorm. It was a fairy tale moment--clear blue sky, clouds floating by, gentle golden sun shining (how rare for Boston to have good weather like this!). I don't remember our conversation, but it must have been about "how come we've never run into each other before," "what are you doing this summer," "what do you like to do on campus." He was off to see his girlfriend in Calirfornia, I was about to be roped into climbing for the first time (given my extensive involvement with OA, aka Outdoor Adventures, a student organization on campus). </p>
<p> I was a TA for the OA class when he and his friends took the class in the fall. Tyler, who would become my boyfriend a year and a half later, was also in the class, but at the time he was invisible to me. I only had eyes for Abe. I don't know how it happened, but all of a sudden I was spending all of my time with Abe. And I told myself, we were just really good friends and I'm helping him get over his break up. We talked about anything and everything under the sun, about philosophy, about love, about which we both knew nothing. Everyone thought we were a couple; I secretly wished we were a couple. We weren't. We never were. And somehow I was fine with it. </p>
<p> Junior year came around, and I wanted to prove to myself that I wasn't obsessed with him anymore. I started going out with the guy that ended up raping me. Abe started hanging out with other friends. He didn't seem happy; I doubt I seemed any happier. After winter break, no one saw him again. I was too engulfed in the rape aftermath to pay attention to him.</p>
<p> Six years later, I find myself standing on the doorsteps of an Indian restaurant in Prague, peering through the windows at bald Czech men dressed like yogis, and wondering what it would be like for us to meet each other again. One of the guys saw me. I waved. I pushed open the door to a stranger's smile. </p>
<p> "Welcome! We are having a Hare Krishna party." <br>
"Hi! I'm Abe's friend."<br>
"Abe?"<br>
"Abraham? Is that how you say it in Czech?"<br>
"Abraham? Abraham...Oh AbraHAM" "yeah he's in the back"</p>
<p> No words can describe the kind of normalness when we saw each other. We just smiled at each other and said hi, before he asked if I wanted tea or food.</p>
<p> I sat down, settled in. My eyes followed Abe everywhere still, just like they did when I was in college with him. And I realized in that moment: it never mattered to me what we did, as long as I could be next to Abe. It didn't matter if he didn't feel the same way about me--Abe always chose things based on what he wanted, whether I was there or not, and I would always choose to be there, whether I liked it or not. I realized what I knew this entire time: Abe is the only person I had ever loved this way in my life. </p>
<p> For a moment I hated myself for being there. I knew nothing about Hare Krishna. I only heard of them because someone told me that's what Abe was doing now. What did I get myself into? When the singing and chanting was done, Abe asked for an arrangement so that he could translate the upcoming lecture for me. And he did, word for word. (for the record, it actually turned out to be an exceptionally healing experience. The lecture there was exactly what I needed to hear, and it will continue to shape my internal debate about religion. More on that another time) </p>
<p> I had never paid that much attention to what was said--whether it was because it was Abe translating it, or it was because that was the topic of the lecture, I will never know. I'll happily accept it's because of a combo of both. A part of the lecture was about reigning in the wandering mind, a very common topic in meditation and something I struggle with in my own meditation. I couldn't help my wandering mind. I wanted it to wander. I kept looking at Abe. Not just his jawline, but also the kind of peace and the settled-in-the-moment presence that he has, something I had never seen in him before. I'm genuinely happy for him this is what he has in his life now. </p>
<p> I didn't have a lot of time to stay and talk to him before catching the flight back home. I had so many things I wanted to ask him. "Abe, tell me what happened in the last six years?"</p>
<p> He gestured with his hand, "just this. I just decided to come."</p>
<p> That was all I needed to hear. That simple statement meant so much more for me than he can ever comprehend, as I'm contemplating what my true passions in life are. It's as simple as just deciding to do it.</p>
<p> I wanted to ask him more questions. He was one of the only people that knew me before the rape, and just didn't talk to me at all after the rape happened. I wanted to ask him if he saw that I was a different person, what changed, and what part of me was missing. And I realized it didn't matter--I knew all the answers, inside of me. I just needed time to discover them all. </p>
<p> He sent me off with books and posters. He asked if I wanted extra cookies. I took over what he couldn't do with one hand, never missing a beat, like six years didn't stand before us, and I was still peeling an orange and sharing it with him. </p>
<p> What now? </p>
<p> "<i>It's better to feel pain <br> Than nothing at all <br> The opposite of love's indifference <br> -- The Lumineers </i>"</p>
<p> I mourn for my old self. I never admitted I was in love. Six year later, I understand what it's like to not be in love. I mourn for myself now, the one that is scared and lonely and unsure if there is love to be found in the world, convinced that a part of herself is gone forever. </p>

<p> So what I don't find love again. Maybe I'll never find a love so pure, like the one I used to have. Maybe it was never meant to be. The kind of clarity I have now, clarity that I have seen love, I am capable of loving, it's enough to bring peace of mind. Maybe it feels like I've lost any chance of happiness in this world, but in the wake of the rape is a chance for peace, for finding myself. I won't doubt for a second that I care for Abe, or whoever that will come along and sweep me off my feet one day, but now, I also choose things that I like to do. I also make room for myself. </p>
<p> Here's to leading a life filled with peace, guided by love. </p>


<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<div class="section" id="2024/09/30"> 2024/09/30 </div>
<p>Freshly returned from a wonderful trip to Copenhagen (details <a href = "travel.html#2024/09/30">here</a>), hosted by a dear friend from the MBA. Just received news of the 4th engagement among people I know, just within the month of September. I sure hope this is the last one of the month, considering it is 23:00 as I type these words. And to be completely honest, news of this latest engagement doesn't sit well with me, because I was once friends with the guy, and was offended and ended the friendship when he kept making misogynist comments. Should I feel guilty that I was the first person to encourage him to go out with his soon to be bride? I just genuinely hope he has become a more repsectful person. </p>
<p>The trip turned out to be a good chance to step away from the busy-ness of my life and just to be free with my thoughts as I roamed the city. I have a lot of compassion for myself as I realized where a lot of them surfaced. </p>
<p>The day before departure, I decided to give birth control another chance -- and gave up less than 24 hours later. I didn't feel like myself. I don't know how to describe it -- it felt like a huge blanket covering all my senses. I felt blind to my true preferences. </p>
<p>It's not like I know the answer anyways. My feminine identity has always been a difficult topic for me to broach. Growing up, I dreamed of being a boy. I said my favorite color was blue so that I won't be girly and get pink things. Looking back now, I don't know if it's because I saw boys were treated better than girls (thank you Confucious), or if I was self-conscious for having a chest flatter than a cardboard box, or if my soul felt like it was always stuck in the wrong body and needs to spend a lifetime reconciling with it on a daily basis. I am actively scared of my period, despite being able to calmly butcher a chicken. Blood isn't the problem. Being forced to face my femininity is. Yet again, I don't know if these voices are my own. The other night, while biking to choir practice at night, I passed Porta Nuova, and in the soft orange glow of the street lights, I saw a face that reminded me of someone that I dream of seeing again. I was shocked by how much I longed for that person, and even more shocked by how just seeing a beautiful face in the crowd would have this effect on me. I went a bit further with the feeling, and saw the part of me that wants to acknolwedge beauty, and to feel beautiful. Growing up, I was told that being beautiful was a bad thing. That if I had long hair I would be stupid. That looking at myself in the mirror was stinky. I wore uniforms every day and wasn't allowed to put my hair in anything but a pony tail, because I went to a public high school. I wish my poor fashion taste was the only side effect manifesting in my life. </p>
<p>Being a woman scares me. Maybe it has to do with the rape, maybe it will exist even without the rape. I had a hard time falling asleep on Friday night, from an unknown source of anxiety, and as I wrestled with the treatment of rape in Buddhism (and hello to every other religion out there that doesn't consider rape a sin but will address a woman's virginity as property), I started to realize and acknowledge what was actually keeping me up: how much I hated what the old man at the flower shop did, forcefully grabbing my face and trying to kiss me without my consent. I cannot let go of that image. It felt, and still feels, so familiar to be forced into doing something I don't want to, and screaming silently in protest. All the violation... I might not consciously remember them all, but my body does, and hates every single one of them. Rape is noteworthy. It shocks people. It's the day to day small moments that get under my skin and make me feel like there is no place on this earth to hide. It's the man on the street asking me to get dinner with him, and not taking my no for an answer, but will stop pestering me the minute I bring up "boyfriend." It pains me that my own no isn't enough. I need another man to say no on my behalf. A man will not respect another woman's boundaries, but a man will respect another man's boundaries. </p>
<p>It's safer to be in this world with a boyfriend. </p>
<p>What is this ridiculous world that we live in, that my no doesn't matter because I'm a woman, but once I'm claimed and owned by another man, his boundaries that pertain to my vaginal and physical integrity is respected?</p>
<p>This might well be why I have been desperately searching for the love of my life for years, so that I don't have to look over my shoulder every three seconds. This also might be why I almost compulsively feel like I have to have sex with someone on a first date--I am so sensitive to others' sexual attention, and am almost always right about another person's ulterior motives, whether overt or subconscious. If I am the person initiating sex, I can be the person to take over the narrative power, I can control how the story ends: it ends. </p>
<p>I know unless I resolve this, I will never feel comofrtable enough to love a man, or build anything close to a fulfilling relationship with a man. At this moment in time, things look rather bleak: I don't trust that my no will mean anything to the world. What's the point of practice saying no if it is going to be ignored anyways?</p>
<p>It was never an issue of authenticity. The world is cruel, it never gave most people a chance to say no and have them be respected. I'm too disillusioned to think the world is changeable. I'm tired of opening my heart again and think maybe this time, the story will take a different fork in the age old plot. It's all futile. I knew it the minute I read Kafka at age 12. I'm more than twice the age now, having spent more than half of my life lying to myself that the world isn't like this--just to fit into the ridiculousness. I don't want to anymore. This world is not worthy of my love, my innocence, my strength to love every day, every second, time and time again, despite the betrayal, the hurt, the disgusting chain of control of patriarchy, the "step in line" and "shut up it isn't that bad".</p>
<p>Is life worth living if it's fundamentally unjust? </p>
<p>I know humanity is flawed, but how flawed do we have to be before we realize that some injustices have no equivalent in beauty and magnanimity?</p>

<p>My friend asked me a question this weekend that I couldn't answer: "since you've been on so many dates, what's the best one you've been on?" My mind went blank. I was shocked, but I really couldn't recall any single date where I didn't feel the overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety of violation. I almost immediately check out of my body and go on auto-pilot down the path of initiating sex. It feels impossible to meet someone that I can be completely myself around. I don't know when I have to give up the romantic ideal, of the existence of this person, and where I should still uphold high standards and expectations. I just wish one day, I will feel safe enough to go on a date without feeling like I am on the verge of having to take over narrative power. Or if I am in the presence of someone truly trust worthy, at least take one extra breath, and know I am not in danger. </p>



<div class="section" id="2024/09/22"> 2024/09/22</div>
<p>For those of you into rose bud thorns: this week had many memorable events and less memorable people. Thorns: the old man at the flower shop gave me a rose then tried to grab my face and kiss me (Ironice because he gave me a rose, but frankly I wish I spat in his face); Chinese lady at the patronato who invented and misexplained Italian legislation in three different ways (next level bureaucracy). Buds: work permit having a next step, voice lessons, going to Copenhagen, thinking and reflecting on Esther Perel & Pema Chodron. Roses: news of friend getting married, gynocologist explaining to me the shape of my uterus and showing me where my ovaries are on the ultrasound for the first time, getting aperitivo / walking dogs / catching up / going on walks with friends, last minute took time off and climbed outside on Thursday morning, my voice teacher's concert, threw another successful dinner party, catching up with friend from the other side of the ocean. </p>
<p>This week had a completely different energy compared to last week. Monday morning, while completely freaked out about whether I can stay in Italy after my current permit expires, I realized the kind of stress that comes with being an expat who chose to leave her birth country: uncertainty in citizenship and residency. It's nothing new. I've consciously chosen to deal with it since the age of 15. Every year, I would not know if I could continue this life that I have chosen for myself after my visa expiration. Only after a successful visa renewal would I start to place a little bit more trust in the continuation of the status quo, and often, even when the new school year really started, I would still not believe or trust that it was real. My mind came up with a trillion what ifs that would stop this life: not getting into college, not getting a job, crazy president, rampant discrimination against Asians, not winning the visa lottery. Usually those were just my anxiety ruling my consciousness, until it really came true, the not winning visa lottery part, and I had to change my life completely. I mean, it was a welcome change, and I was ready to leave Boston and my depression behind, and not getting the visa lottery almost seemed like a convenient excuse. Still, the reality was: I booked a one way ticket to a new country where I didn't hold the passport of, didn't speak the language of, or know anyone in. Against all odds, I stayed, and took root, and now I'm letting my inner problem solver take over: I will figure this work permit out so I can stay. </p>
<p>It's not without a cost. Living in uncertainty of residency status since age 15, I learned to let go of the "10 year plan," the "5 year plan." I could only plan for one year at a time. It's lean, it's agile, but it's exhausting. On this overcast day, next to the sand colored side walk outside of my office, while on the phone and explaining to my mom the extent of my anxiety, I admitted to myself for the first time that I craved stability. All of a sudden, this voracious void within me had a name. It felt less scary, almost as if I could befriend it, because it made sense: for the longest time, I thought I needed to run away from stability. Then I rethought about it: I needed to run away precisely because I've craved stability all my life. </p>
<p>I used to think stability meant my cage, my chain, where I was a burden, and I was not allowed to be myself. To which my therapist raised his eyebrow and said "you call that emotional stability?". Growing up in Shanghai, in our cramped apartment, I had physcial stability, sure, but every single action of mine, my very existence, was under extreme scrutiny. I was never allowed to appear other than happy, no matter the intimadation, abandonment, violation, teasing, or bullying that I got from classmates, teachers, my very own parents. </p>
<p>The first opportunity I had to be independent, I ran away as far away as possible from my parents as a middle finger to their years of emotional neglect. Anything was better than being next to the same people who hurt me yet didn't allow me to voice the hurt, then dumped their frustration of bad parenting onto a problem that I needed to solve for them. This past summer, when I traveled in the Dolomites with my parents, I couldn't fall asleep on our first night together: I was convinced they would wake me up for no apparent reason and just unleash their rage onto me. They didn't that night, but in the subsequent days, they defaulted back to expecting me to cater to their every single physical and emotional need. Every. Single. Second. </p>
<p>I had long ago given up hopes that they would one day mature enough to face the kind of hurt they have caused me. They have grown a lot, and my mom even recently asked me, "what do you do when you have really strong emotions? how do you process them?" Whether this growth is a natural course of aging, or it's from the guilt of finding out the raped daughter witheld the violation for five years out of mistrust in their ability to emotionally support, we will never know, but for now I am okay with the kind of physical and emotion distance that lets us be on friendly terms for most of the year. </p>
<p>It makes sense that I need the distance, as far away as possible, from anything that was familiar to me in Shanghai, so that I could just breathe. But now, I am tired of running away and hoping that creating chaotic and unpredictable movement will ever mean the opposite of stability. Physical stability was never what I needed to run from. It was emotional instability that I wanted distance from. </p>
<p>I knew when I moved to Turin that I wanted to give myself a chance to rest, stay, take roots, and grow. And now I'm doing it, with the full awareness of the kind of healing that is taking place. What started as a desperate need for rest has turned into something nurturing. </p>
<p>Last weekend, for myriad reasons, marked the end of the boy crazy era for me. I'm convinced that the yeast infection I have right now is my vagina's cry for "finally you are leaving me the fuck alone" and detoxing all the unnecessary pressure and attention I've given it in the last two years, in attempts of proving I was worthy of love. Now, filling up moments that would otherwise be spent looking outwards at others to fill the void of instability, I've started re-reading my journal from two years ago, when I first moved to Italy. I saw how I've grown and dealt with the growing pains. I also saw how accurate my instincts were: for every single guy I fucked, I knew how our relationship would end within the first few interactions. Case in point: "I am glad I felt the glrious high and the excitement when Enrico was here. But equal to the high is the sadness I experience right now," from Nov 2022, a week after we had met. We had high highs. Rereading my journal entry of that time brings me to the same giggly and bubbly mood I had when I first fell for him. The low lows are what happened in January. Eight months later, I see how the pain was not just pure misery. It was also a chance for reflection, of recognizing my own patterns. </p>
<p>Thanks to Esther Perel's words, I'm reviewing my personal concepts of love and sex and discovering how differently I relate to these two often intertwined and interchangeable concepts. During 2022, my year of sexual liberation, I discovered how fun and alive sex and connection with another person could feel, rather than the kind of burden and cutting off a part of myself that I understood love to be. Maybe sexual liberation is my personal liberation of my identity too, because it opened a window for me to understand who I am. Through the most intimate interactions with another person, I saw parts of myself that I never knew were there. I know I have a long way to go before I can figure out what love is for myself. If it really takes another 26 years of conscious practice to unlearn my old understanding of love and relearn a new kind of love, the love that makes me feel whole, alive, uncompromisingly myself, I would do it in a heartbeat. I want to do it for every single heartbeat that I have left on this earth. </p>

<div class="section" id="2024/09/15"> 2024/09/15</div>
<p>I shuddered when I typed in the date. What started out as an intention to keep up with updating my blog weekly fizzled as weeks and months of work and life piled up, sped by, left me spinning in the dust and waiting for everything to settle. Single again, this seems the perfect time to take up this old project, as I re-google how vim works and how to git commit files again. I will say it does feel nice that earlier months' of programming intentions paid off, and now I hopefully don't have to fiddle around with the jump button any more. </p>
<p>I remember wanting to write about FOMO last time. I feel that right now is the right time to address it, especially with new experiences to enrich my own thoughts. </p>
<p>I vividly remember having a bad case of FOMO in college (as confirmed by all of my close friends during and after our time together). I could not stop. I needed to be out there and be with everyone and do everything. I needed to make everyone happy: good grades to please my parents (aka source of tuition), good at listening to keep my friends close, good at leading OA trips so I could also go into nature and escape the mess that BC was, good at social life to impress this unknown judgemental crowd that would silently rate my performance (turns out it's just the multitude of inner critic that exists within me-- but how could I have known this at the time?). Unsurprisingly, throughout this whole time, I never stopped to ask myself what I would have wanted. Covid put the world to a grinding halt, and being depressed and in therapy during that time was almost a blessing in disguise--I couldn't miss out on anything, because there wasn't anything to miss out on. Then, coming to business school in Italy meant I had to be around 100 of the same people every day for 9 months. I got sick quite quickly, and decided that no social life was worth getting sick for.</p>
<p>That may have been the first time where I consciously decided to not do something despite my FOMO, but I had never come to terms with the extent that FOMO existed within me. Even when I chose to go WWOOFing or climbing, I chose them partially out of my own desires for wellbeing, but another undeniable part was to do them so that I could be different, so that I could be the radical rejection and middle finger to the MBA and the capitalistic society that we live in. That was my moral high ground so that I could feel cool and removed and better than the people around me, the ignorance, the going with the flow.</p>
<p>Deep inside, I am not any different from the people around me, and I was using FOMO as a distraction to face my own pain. When I started dating Luca, I remember being completely surprised by how going to his family's house felt like sinking into a huge, comfortable cloud, where every single cell of me was supported. I didn't need to impress anyone. I felt liberated in a way that I never have felt before-- being able to put aside my anxiety and take a long nap on a Sunday afternoon, after family lunch. Pain free for the first time, I didn't feel the need to seek out other things to do-- all was here. With him. In those moments. And yet that only lasted a short while before my own reality caught up with me again: what about work? Visa? Future? Farm? Travel? Ambitions? ... and the list went on. Everything became a loss when I couldn't act, and I lost a part of me in the process. It pains me to not be able to articulate what it was that I couldn't build with him. </p>
<p>Being the hopeless romantic I am, why didn't I just move to Germany to be with Luca? I remember last year, after Paolo's farm, I desperately wanted to return and build a life with him, despite all the gaps that might come between us: the different upbringings, the different realities that we faced, the different life trajectories. Why is it that with Luca, I couldn't do the same? How firm was my bottom line of "never move to chase love"? Did I romanticize a life with Paolo because I knew it could never be real? </p>
<p>Time and again, I have fallen in love with another person traveling in a parallel universe: time, geography, emotional state. Was it just my illusion and my imagination that saw this could work? Time and again, I will continue to fall in love with that person: unattainable, and yet just one more step of self improvement away. Of course anything can be romanticized when I know, deep down, that I would never have that love (another example of vacuously true statement: anything can be real if you start with a false reality, because it was never real to begin with).</p>
<p>What's left is mourning and grieving that old image of love, the love that is so romantic that will shatter all of my pain from abandonment and turn me into a new person, worthy of love, and I just have to find the right person to give me that love. It helped protect me in those earliest years of memory, with the logic that love having not yet arrived meant at least I was still lovable. Maybe it has taken 21 extra years for me to realize my inherent lovability, independent of another person. </p>
<p>I recently spoke with a friend from Turin, your typical guy who was born and raised here and will die here. He had just spent a month on the Camino de Santiago, and met a lovely person on the trail. When I asked him, why not go to Paris to be with her if you like her so much? His answer surprised me and pained me: "becaue my identity is here. because my wellbeing is here. i will not leave what i have."</p>
<p>How much must he love his life that another love won't make him leave. I wish I had that kind of love for myself to put myself first. I'm also jealous of him. How much easier of a life it would be to just fall back onto a sense of security on your identity because you have been in the same place your whole life? Never questioning. Using it to answer life's major decisions. It's so liberating to be blind to the rest of the world. Or, in my friend's case, having seen the rest of the world and still ACTIVELY deciding that Turin is the best place in the whole world. To me this is still unthinkable, both considering I hated my childhood home and Turin for the same reason: I feel trapped there. I needed to leave to keep my soul alive, but it cost me so so so much over the years in physical and emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>Is it also time to lay to rest my turmoil of constantly convincing myself: "I made the right choice leaving Shanghai / Richmond / Boston / Milan"? Each time, I left with a one way ticket, not knowing where life would take me.  When I've solved so much that life has thrown at me (or gotten myself out of messes that I created for myself, depending on how you read it), it's easy to think of myself as invincible, and anything can be fixed when I've worked hard enough. It's completely egotistical, as my mom rightly pointed out. I even fixed my way out of depression, out of rape, and that's why I keep going back to therapy, so that I wouldn't be back in that same dark space again. And yet, I've never left, because I feel closer than ever to slipping away and losing everything that I've never known in the dark abyss of meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't need to justify any of my decisions to myself. I did what I felt like in those moments, and I'm still enjoying the ride. There's no point in stopping what I'm doing, or to convince anyone that my choices are better than theirs. Maybe in another dimension this will all make sense, and until I can understand the meaning of all of my choices, there is no point in agonizing over them.</p>


<div class="section" id="2024/04/04"> 2024/04/04 </div>
<p>Today is my last day on the farm. Tomorrow morning, I will scoop donkey shit again before going back to a jungle of concrete buildings. Sounds of cars will replace the birdsongs that I hear daily. I will be sad to leave behind the view of 5 cats on the porch looking at me whenever I open the door, but I am happy to be away from the allergies. I am eager to get back to my routine, but make space for old hobbies (cooking) and new endeavors (balcony garden). I will miss cleaning the donkey stalls first thing in the morning, as well as feeding donkeys carrots and apples and singing them lullabies before bed. But I also want the space to not have to worry about taking care of other living beings except for myself. I think this means the vacation was successful. </p>
<p>Today is also the traditional Chinese "day of the dead". It's not nearly as festive as dia de los muertos (from what my Mexican friend described). It's a solemn day, one during which we visit the tombs of the loved ones we had lost. I had never had a chance to do that--not because no one close to me had died, but now because I cannot be home to visit them. I will be looking for QingTuan (they translate as 'green balls') when I get back. They're filled with red bean paste (sweet) or pork floss and salted duck egg yolk (savory), and wrapped in a green dough made from sticky rice, not unlike mochi, but with a pungent flavor from mugwort (a medicinal herb), whose juice is used as water to bind the sticky rice flour. Zia gave me some mugwort from her garden, and the smell reminded me so much of eating QingTuan. It also reminded me of elders in my life, who helped raise me, and fed me the most delicious food in the whole world. I want to cook again. I miss cooking. </p>
<p> Cooking was how I found solace and peace when I lived in Richmond, alone at 16. I used to think I was so grown up. Now that I'm ten years older, I realize how unfair of me it was to expect myself to be an adult at 16. Cooking was also how I stayed grounded in college. I hated everything about Boston, and especially the food. I was lucky to have upperclassmen friends who let me use their kitchen, so that I had a chance to make space for myself in the whirlwind of college. Cooking was how I healed after the rape. I signed up for a food studies class at a neighboring university and routinely skipped my finance classes (my worst grade in college) to cook and escape and be. I skipped my own graduation to attend the potluck dinner at the food studies class, because that's where I found community and found people who cared for me in a way I wanted to be cared for. When covid hit and I was living with my ex, I felt stir-crazy from the lockdown. I made a different dish for every single meal we had. That was my way of bringing variety into my life. The kitchen in that old house had everything I needed to cook: all the ingredients, all my favorite pots, pans, knives, tools, and I hit my culinary peak then. Looking at myself now, I sometimes wonder if it's because of Italy that I've gotten lazy about cooking, or if it's the constant moving and the feeling of restlessness and uncertainty about where I will be for the next few years that makes me hesitant to invest in cookware. Out of all the things that I missed about Boston, it was my castiron pan that strikes me the most. I'm sure I will build up the write kitchen again when the time comes. I'm still not sure if right now is the time. </p>
<p> It takes effort and energy and space to cook. When I get home from work, all I have energy for is reheating the food that I made the last weekend. At 8pm, most grocery stores are closed. I only have energy to go to the fresh food market once a week (Porta Palazzo), but there is only so much fresh greens and vegetables that one can eat and cook before they all rot. And frankly, I haven't felt inspired by any recipes to cook. I know I can still cook like before--the Chinese new year celebration was a huge success, but it took so long to prepare everything and clean up that I didn't want to think about cooking for another few months. Work has been consuming all of my creative energy. On the one hand, I lament my new identity as a part of a consulting firm. On the other hand, I am grateful for all the skills and perspectives I'm learning for the first time. It is difficult and painful work, but I am gaining so much appreciation for how I see the world differently. Still, it would be nice if I had energy to enjoy cooking after getting off work. I suppose this part is what I need to work on: the part of not letting my imposter syndrom rage at work that my sense of wellbeing feels like a shirveled up raisin, as opposed to the watermelon bursting of energy that it could be.</p>
<p>I said something similar to my therapist last week. His first comment was: remember you had a crisis 2.5 months ago. It's very recent. True, when my plane landed in Malpensa in the beginning of the year, I would not have imagined my life unfolding the way it eventually did. When my friend picked up the phone when I said I was not doing well, I didn't dare to think more than 3 seconds ahead. It's a miracle that I am standing on the other end of 3 months, unscathed, older, wiser, stronger, but also kinder to myself and gentler to the world. He was also the person to point out that I never seemed happy when I was with Enrico: first the death march in the Alps, then the pregnancy scare, and the countless little moments where he avoided and ignored my attempts for connection. Sure, the highs we shared felt like extraordinary highs, but most of the time it was the feeling of being absolutely invisible and alone. I cried my way through, since the beginning when we hiked so much that I thought I was going to fall off the mountain and die, to the end when I was on the verge of suicide and being told I was a burden to him going out. I'm grateful for a therapist who helps me put things into perspective, but first and foremost unafraid to look away from my deepest pain and the moments of absolute anguish. I'm learning to do this for myself too. </p>
<p> I had a thought about routines today: I like routines when it's filled with things I enjoy, or leading to something I will enjoy. I dislike them otherwise. Most of my life, I have either avoided routines or made drastic changes to my routines over the years. This adds up: it's only recently that I've stopped hating my life. I thought about what making space meant too: I need to make space (aka time) for the things that I enjoy in my routine if I want to enjoy them, instead of spending time doing other things in while thinking about how nice it would be to do something else. The hard part is picking and accepting which are the things that I truly enjoy. How to do that, I'm still not exactly sure, but I feel inspired by donkeys.Donkeys are extremely smart and sensitive animals. They almost always scurry away when I approach them too quickly, or make noises they don't recognize. They like it when I sing my choir songs to them (yes I have been practicing my choir songs in the donkey field. it's a free concert for them and an ego boost for me). I want to run towards the people and things I love with an open heart and make space for them in my life, and run away from situations that make me feel not myself. I hope 26 will be a year filled with clarity. </p>




<div class="section" id="2024/03/25"> 2024/03/25 </div>
<p>I am sitting in a cozy bed, in a cozy house, on a cozy farm, in Assisi. I met Zia from WWOOFing last summer, and we connected immediately despite the 53 year age gap. They were the people I wrote to when I needed a place to stay in Italy, to get away from Turin, and to spend my birthday away from home. DHL finally, miraculously, delivered my passport, a month later than scheduled. Hence, I am not sitting in my cramped childhood bed, in a borderline suffocatingly small apartment, in an overcrowded megatropolis. It's better like this. I wouldn't be reminded of what Enrico and I did on my childhood bed, which I will regret for the rest of my life, because I opened up the deepest part of myself for someone who never deserved to see it in the first place. </p>
<p>The air is clean. The valley makes me feel safe. There are no sounds of cars. When I meditate, I hear birds, ducks, chickens, the sound of the wind, the sound of the leaves. I see the sun slowly making its way through the day and how its lines divide the room into different corners. I had barely enough time to enjoy all the being and non doing moments of the weekend that Monday felt like a complete blow into my stomach and knocked all the air out of me. The sun is shining for the entire time I locked myself inside to work, unsuccessfully, preoccupied. I have to admit, after a certain point, that it's not just Turin and cities that make me unable to sit still and face myself. It is hard to do anywhere on this earth. There is no pristine land, where I can hide from all of my woes, like the wild-flower meadows in <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>. It's going to be the work of a lifetime to remind myself to create peace within myself, instead of looking elsewhere. </p>
<p>"This is the first time I thought spring was beautiful. I'm born in spring. I never appreciated the season, but this morning, I saw green buds and shoots everywhere, and despite being annoyed by the pollen and the still cold winds, I felt hope knocking at my heart. That even when the branches are bare and leaves from last winter are on the trees, the buds are forming, the birds are chirping. All the branches that will bear fruit in the summer are full of blossoms, visible and invisible. Green leaves are emerging from the ground. I'm reminded that despite feeling hopeless, despite experiencing tough times, times are changing, the planet and the earth is shifting and changing. I saw a pale silver moon behind the clouds. It's the clearest and shiniest moon I had seen in months, possibly since being in the Alps last summer. I thought, for the first time, that the sun will be at the same position as I was born on my birthday, while the moon will be at the same position on my lunar birthday. They are the same and different, just like I am since my birth."</p>
<p>Since early March, I have started traveling and hiking and climbing again, leaving me exhausted at the end of the weekend and unable to face my thoughts. I needed to take my mind off of the spotlight I have put myself under. The only challenge is sifting through the endless pages of my new Legami journal to find what's been the most pressing on my mind. It's fun looking back at all the crazy dreams I had: being in a hospital as a nurse, being in prison, navigating through an endless changing room to get to the pool for swim practice, leading an OA trip to Florida again (exactly 4 years after I ran the last one), looking for old friends, being with middle school friends. The scariest one by far was the minute by minute play of a complete pregnancy, where I woke up at month 3 and was completely soaked in my sweat (I never sweat in my sleep), fell back asleep and continued to dream until month 7, feeling desperate that this is still not over and my body was still invaded by this child of mine that I'm supposed to love. I probably would have sufferred irreversible brain damage if I had to experience child birth in my sleep, and thankfully my brain did not let this happen. When I woke up, it was a sigh of relief that I am not yet living this reality, and a desperate call for my raging baby fever to stop: please, just let me not be a mother for another few years so that I can let myself enjoy my life like the childhood I never got to enjoy.</p>
<p>Right now would be the perfect place to end this post. Me being me, I refuse to let it, despite the ticking clock and aching neck that got me this far. Purely because this has been on my mind for weeks now. I want to write about Enrico so that I can stop thinking about him. I want my journal entries to stop sounding like broken records of longing for him.</p>
<p>Mar 4: I thought about Enrico a ton today. All the breathtaking beauty and awe-inspiring views we have seen together. ... tomorrow, I could write about the beautiful places I've seen with Enrico and pay homage to those feelings. </p>
<p>Mar 5: dream [I asked my parents to put me in a time capsule and wait for me in the future, because the day-to-day experience of being alive right now and feeling everything is too much to deal with. Then, at departure, my equipment caught on fire. Dad stood there to watch it burn, instead of helping me. I rushed to move everything out of the way. There was a bag of ropes, and I couldn't tell if it's still on fire, so I took it outdoors to check and stay at a safe distance. Enrico was there, as a physicist invovled in the project. I tried to tell him to get out of the way of the explosion path, but he doesn't move at all, and there were doubts about where his loyalty lied. I got so frustrated, I just left him on his path of destruction. I walked down the stairs. He kept trying to tell me "this is temporary", and he'll do a PhD soon after the lab stint, but he also said this is a lie and he actually wanted to stay in this state forever, and that's just what he tells people to shut them up]</p>
<p>Mar 7: going to Milan is hard, because it's filled with memories of Enrico and the life I had with him for the few months we were together. But were they truly moments I'd long for now? Or were they just extensions of the life I had?</p>
<p>Mar 11: I still think about Enrico a lot. Wishing he was here and different. Instead of acknolwedging and accepting that he was not, is not, and will never be the person I wish he is. Even thought I know this rationally, emotionally it's constant turmoil trying to remember it. Wishing his message for reconciliation and continuing our life will arrive. Even if I don't want to be next to a person who is next to me but constantly looking away. </p>
<p>Mar 13: I still think about Enrico a lot. I don't know what the feelings are. Maybe wishing that he was here and different. But I know now that what he has acted like has told me everything I need to know about him, and how he will be for the rest of his life. Being together will mean betrayal for both of us. </p>
<p>Marc 17: I could not stop thinking about Enrico. I want to free my brain from this psychological torture of imaginary conversations and imaginary life together. It's gone. I deleted everything I knew about him, and still I miss him like crazy. It's as if I've locked myself in a dark room with his imaginary being, the kind of person I wish he was, and had conversations with this person. Never beginning, never ending. ... Maybe I'm afraid I'll forget our time together, the traveling and the beautiful things we've seen. I'm scared I'll lose the adventurous part of me. I'm scared this is all that Turin has to offer. I'm scared I'll get restless and be on the move and forget all the healing and rest that I've gotten. </p>
<p> ------------- </p>
<p>We hiked in the Alps with backpacks almost a third of our weight, going up and down scree slopes, caught the most breath taking sunsets and shooting stars. In the secluded August woods, when most of Italy was on vacation at the sea, we fucked everywhere in the mountains. We gorged ourselves full of raspberries. We ate cheese straight from the arpeggio. We hitchhiked back to Italy from the border of Switzerland, and our stench filled the entire car. </p>
<p>We backpacked through Morocco, just after the earthquake. We spent more hours than necessary on buses. We navigated scams and scary people. We hiked up the tallest dune in Merzouga and looked at the milky way in the Sahara. We walked across God's bridge, hands interlocked, and I prayed our hands would be fasted for the rest of our lives. We dove into the deep turqoise stream under the bridge, chilled to the bone, and I hoped that we could also dive into each other's hearts, and that years later, when we look back, we would smile at each other and remember how young and crazy and carefree we were. </p>
<p>I met his parents and relatives at graduation. Every single person there saw the stars in his eyes when he looked at me. I fell in love with his family, his dog, everything around him. We went to an abandoned castle and ate gelato. I wanted to live in a castle like that, with him. </p>
<p>He helped me move to Turin. I helped him get his visa to China, and planned an entire trip for us. We saw shooting stars on the plane, 10000 meters above sea level. We shivered in the heaviest snow that JiangNan had seen in 40 years. We saw mountains that looked like ivories. We watched streams of people in neon signs and endless noises. We drank cups after cups of modern China tea. We hiked to the top of the avatar mountains. Through his eyes, I discovered China, as if for the first time. I showed him my hometown, my history, the deepest parts of my wounds that I had never shown anyone else.</p>
<p>I miss Enrico tremendously. It feels like I'm committing a crime to write it down. I feel like I shouldn't miss him, after having gone through all that I've gone through in his absence: the anguish I felt, in moments where I was tethered to this world by a mere breath, when he looked the other way. I know DHL losing my passport was a blessing in disguise, because had I gotten ahold of it, I would have been on the first flight to Tokyo to track him down, instead of giving myself the chance to discover Turin and meet all the new friends I have in my life, settling into a routine, rediscovering choir and swimming, lead climbing outside for the first time, having extra energy to take work seriously, treating myself to ice cream because I wanted to and not because I earned it. And even though I enjoy my life now, I would throw it all away in a heartbeat, if Enrico shows up and stands by my side.(A vacuously true statement at best-- I hope the last few months of intense therapy will stop me in my trakcs.)</p>
<p>What's not to miss about him. He had everything I valued, even the debilitating anxiety and crippling perfctionism: the fair price to pay for success. I thought I could save myself by saving him. Italy was the radical rejection of all the things I thought I needed to not be like this anymore, and all these things that once fueled me now beckons like the beacon of green light in F.S. Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, all calling me to "be more and better deserving of all the good things that you had to deny yourself to achieve." He is me. I am him. Yet we are different, and I can never make him not him. I can barely make me not me. It takes effort every day to decide to show up in the world with hope, with love, with trust, with all the things I wish there were more of in the world. </p>
<p>What we had has been broken, and not even love can glue it back together. What's left is the longing that one day, someone that I thought was equally handsome and capable would show up in my life, but aware of his own emotions and unfraid to be imperfect, just as adventurous, and would be by my side, through thick and thin. We will go see the Northern lights. We will hike up volcanoes. We will find an abandoned farm somehwere and bring it back to life. Even in the coldest winters of depression or the hottest of rages, during moments of feeling lost, in this adventure of life, we will find our way back to each other, to the farm that we have made life out of. </p>

<div class="section" id="2024/03/03"> 2024/03/03 </div>
<p>I came back from a hike last week, looked at my scheduled for the following week and thought about how I've gotten shitty sleep, and said, "nah, self care this week looks like not spending 2 hours updating my blog."</p>
<p>I hadn't slept this poorly in a long time. It was a combination of work stress and my hot room that made my anxiety too much to handle, that made me wake up every hour to see if it's light out and if I needed to go to work. I knew I needed to make a conscious decision to prioritize my mental health. This week, with the long hours at work and insane class schedules, I decided to take it easy. And also I started swimming (moving my body in general makes me feel better) again as well. I'm happy to report that my sleep quality has indeed improved.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get into the pool. I'm glad I took the time, because at the beginning of the year, when I wanted to sign up for a swim team again, I did so thinking about the competitions I would be in, or the ripped back that I would gain once again. I didn't feel motivated to swim for external reasons, but the motivation coming from a place of acceptance and self-love had yet to take shape. When I realized I needed to swim to quell my anxiety, I thought this was the right moment. And I'm glad I went. I still am the slowest swimmer on the team, but I smiled when I swam, because I now swim to feel better about myself and know that I'm taking care of myself, rather than beating myself up for being slow and never making it at a competition. I'm there for the extra motivation to move, when I couldn't get myself to move. </p>
<p>The more I swam and went to choir, the more I notice the resemblance of this period in my life with my high school life. Richmond had a river, hills, churches, museums, coffee shops, restaurants, a few universities, and barely any Asians or Asian restaurants. I swam and sang in a choir every day. I have always liked choir, but in high school, I had the attitude that I was better than all of these other people in choir, and felt resentful that they were presented with opportuniteis for universities purely because they were white and grew up in Richmond. Their lives and mine were different from the start, and will continue to be, and for the period of time, when we were in the same physical space, I chose to distance myself. They would never understand the kind of pain and loneliness of being foreign that I had experienced, at age 16, alone in a foreign country, when they have lived on daddy's money their entire lives in the same place. I myself didn't understand the pain, the kind of grieving I was doing for myself: the price I had to pay to follow my instinct of being somewhere else meant giving up comfort, security, familiarity, and just because I've experienced it at age 5 does not make the loss feel any less painful at age 16. I was convinced: I was destined for bigger and better things that I could not yet name, and I'm to leave as soon as possible. </p>
 <p> I can't say I don't feel the same way right now about Turin, feeling like I should be somewhere else better, living a more glamorous life after an MBA, getting paid a better salary, being around the company of other successful 25 year olds. But I don't feel driven by the same things as I used to. I'm admitting to myself my weaknesses, my feelings of not being enough, my heartaches, my struggles, my limitations. I want to rest. I'm letting myself be comfortable, finding and making friends, seeking out the expat community, not wasting time with fake nice people and listening to racist comments. Maybe fundamentally, Turin and Richmond are not that different for me, since these are cities that will never claim me, or be claimed by me. But for a while, I just want to carve out space for myself in this place and feel at ease, and explore all that it has to offer. </p>


<div class="section" id="2024/02/18"> 2024/02/18 </div>
<p>Life is full of struggle as always. New topic of work for this week has been accepting all parts of myself, even the parts that I didn't like. It's amazing to see what has popped up. </p>
<p>Here are direct quotes from my journal entries:</p>
<p> <i>I can continue to imagine a reunion. Maybe another look at each other will show that we shouldn't have been together at all and accept our paths diverging, or see in each other's eyes that we are still as crazy as we were about ach other when we first met, but have gotten to know each other as different people. I don't want to rush the process. I don't want to confuse myself on what it is that I'm actually feeling.</i> </p>
<p><i>At what point will I realize and accept that it's less about how I wanted our story to end, but more about why I don't feel like I deserve to be treated better? Why do I acccept the bare minimum that people put into relationships? Do I treat my own relationship with myself with the bare minimum, and accept that I can't do better? What happens if I do something better? What kind of magic and fireworks will appear? What kind of reconciliation will I find? </i></p>
<p>I will also share what I wrote in the shadow work journal. I cried because I realized I had ignored those parts of myself.</p>
<p>What are you most proud of or what do you feel is your greatest accomplishment? <br>
- Surviving the rape and still be able to enjoy having sex, feel happy, adventurous, and open to new relationships</p>
<p>What do you believe this accomplishment means about you? [this is when I cried] </p>
<p> - That I've been here this entire time, that I never gave up on myself, that I've given myself a chance, day after day, to experience the world in a way that I've wanted to since the moment I was conceived. That no matter what happens in the future, I know I am here with me, to be with myself when times are hard. That I'm awesome, I'm a badass bitch, that I'm courageous and I try time and again and not lose faith in myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also want to take a few lines and share some of the fun things I've done in these past few days / weeks. I would like to eventually port these to my travel page, time permitting. </p>
<p>  Feb 5th, Monday: pizza & live jazz <br>
Feb 10th, Saturday: lunar new year party with Turin friends & special guests from Milan <br>
  Feb 11th, Sunday: Carnivale di Ivrea. I watched grown ass men throw oranges at each other for an entire afternoon in an medieval town. <br>
  Feb 16th, Friday: joined a coworking event. New friends shared "Baci" chocolate at the table, which have a wrapping with a cute sentence on it (yes think Italian fortune cookies). Mine was a quote from Luigi Pirandello: "And love looked at time and laughed, becuase it was of no difference."<br>
  Feb 17th, Saturday: went climbing outdoors at a local crag. Came back and enjoyed conversations with new expat friends at a local beer hall in the middle of an outdoor urban art museum in the historic town center. It's called MAU--Museo di Arte Urbana.<br>
  Feb 18th, Sunday: went to a contemporary art museum inside a castle called "Castello di Rivoli"

<div class="section" id="2024/02/11"> 2024/02/11 痛 </div>
<p>[TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
<p> I was in a lot of pain this week, possibly the most I had allowed myself to feel in my entire life.</p>
<p> Was the rape painful? I don't remember feeling the pain. I remember how hot the room felt from the heat on full blast, while my face was cold against the window, where I looked out into the street lights and lights from other houses, and silently screamed. Was there anyone who could hear me and come to take me out of the room? I watched myself being pinned down onto the bed. I watched myself stiffen and immediately give up when I realized it was a fight I was never going to win. I watched myself drift from fear to despair to nothingness. I stopped feeling, or even thinking that I was going to die. I watched my body being violated so that I could step out of the nightmare as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Was I in pain the months after the rape? I was depressed. I numbed myself with depression so I wouldn't feel the pain. I didn't know how else to stay alive, to face the anger of betraying myself, to face the guilt and blame of putting myself in that room.</p>
<p> Was I in pain when I got the phone call that the rapist could get away with no consequences and still graduate? I felt erased, like my reality wasn't real and my story didn't matter. I got back into the car and pretended that my reality really wasn't real and my story really didn't matter, and kept driving my parents along Highway 1 in California. I hadn't told them about the rape. How could I have trusted them to see my reality and believe in my story, when I failed to be the perfect, unraped daughter? </p>
<p> I romanticize my unraped life. If I had never been raped, I would have perfect emotional control like a normal person. My life would be filled with bliss, I wouldn't have to deal with depression, inconvenient outbursts of anger, anxiety, fear of abandonment, dread that I'm not enough.</p>
<p> How long was I going to pretend that rape is my only trauma? That I had emotionally available parents who taught me how to process my emotions and never abandoned me? </p>
<p> Growing up, my mom's go-to phrase to discpline me was "I have limited patience for you." The only acceptable feelings were happiness--which I was required to feel 100% of the time--and anger--something only my parents were entitled to. I never learned what any other emotions are. I was shamed for feeling homesick and wanted to come home from kindergarten--that was a sign of weakness. "Look at how none of the other kids asked for their parents the same way that you did." I was blamed when there were issues with my host family and they didn't feed me dinner. "Stop being ungrateful." Over the years, I got good at pretending and wearing a smile on my face and saying everything is fine when inside, there were a million ants eating at my heart.</p>
<p> How many more journal entries does it take before I stop writing "I'm so lucky to have met such a powerful, commanding, stoic man, and it's my opportunty to satisfy his sexual needs more"?</p>
<p> I don't want to keep pretending anymore. I want to rewrite my story. It takes pain to get there. </p>
<p> Pain is inconvenient. Pain is when Enrico says "no" to returning my backpack and having a last conversation before we speak ever again. Pain is realizing that the backpack was a power move to have Enrico say yes to me, that I didn't actually want him or the backpack. Pain is realizing I never processed the no that was ignored when my body was violated, and that I just wanted to ignore Enrico's "no". Pain is realizing that I want Enrico to feel what it's like to have his "no" ignored, something I had sworn I would not even do to my worst enemy, and the shock that I would impose it on someone that I had treasured beyond anything in the world. Pain is realizing that Enrico is treating me exactly how I had treated myself for the past 25 years: ignoring my own pain, ignoring my own no, ignoring my desire for connection with myself. Pain is realizing that I didn't accept myself.</p>
<p> Pain is overwhelming. It takes over all my senses. I suffer. I feel angry, sad, anxious. I want an empty room for myself to punch, scream, kick, power over, and destroy everything in my path. </p>
<p> Pain is exhausting. It makes me want to stay in bed and cry with Sealio (my stuffed animal seal). </p>
<p> Pain is fair. It is something everyone experiences, thought unique in its origin and the way it's inflicted. I'm never alone in pain. </p>
<p> In Chinese, the word that means "pain" is composed of two characters: hurt 痛 and suffering 苦. Pain isn't just feeling hurt. Pain is the suffering from feeling hurt. </p>
<p> Pain doesn't go away on its own. Just like physical pain, if the root cause is not identified, or if it's ignored or buried, it accumulates to something truly out of control. Pain needs to be dissected, biopsied, studied, acknowledged, described, accepted, before it can be healed. </p>
<p> Pain is not permanent. It passes eventually. When it does, it leaves some more space in the cluttered room of my heart. It's space where I can hold more emotions with kindness and acceptance. Just like the piercings that I got last year: when the wounds healed, I got to put gems and shiny things in them. </p>
<p> A new friend I met in Torino said: the suffering we feel, when we recover from them, becomes an opportunity for us to help other people grow. </p>
<p> Pain has been a humbling experience for me to realize there are limited things I can do to help myself, and I don't dare to imagine that wars and famine around the world will cease because of my ability to process my own pain into something beautiful. I'm not obsessed with making the world a better place anymore, because I realize there are so few things I can do. </p>
<p> But maybe, just maybe, this will turn into something beautiful. Pain thrived in my mind obsessed with romanticizing the life that is "somewhere else, better, full of bliss, perfect." It does not exist. It's a painful realization, but I cannot look away any longer, because all I can do is to take one moment at a time, one day at a time, until the pain gets better. Pain is teaching me to stay in the present, the here and now, to feel its full depth, because now is the only reality we will ever have.</p>

  <div class="section" id="2024/02/04"> 2024/02/04 初见 </div>
  <p>I cried almost every day this week, even when days are getting easier and easier. I wailed and kicked my sheets one night in bed as a toddler would. Those weren't just tears for me. Those were tears that my younger self wished she was allowed to cry, when she wasn't picked up again. As I discovered this week during therapy, all she really wanted was for someone to hold her hand and go get egg tarts together. I have a vague memory, from the year before I went to boarding kindergarten, where my mom would take me to the People's Square metro station (which is like an underground mall in and of itself), and somehow egg tarts were involved, but I have no memory of what the place looks like. I just remember the smell of the egg tarts, the creamy filling inside, and the crusty pastry supporting the yummy middle. That's why every time I walk past an egg tart shop now, I buy one. Those were happy memories of being with my mother. </p>
  <p>One night, as I was walking home, I thought again about how I would be alone when I went home. But instead of feeling desperately lonely and sad, I saw myself--my identity--just floating in a dark space, the universe, and realized that maybe I really am truly alone. No matter how many people I know and how many friends I make in this life, I am alone in my own brain, floating in the universe. It was a powerful moment of connection with the universe, becuase instead of just feeling connected to the night sky and the stars above, I felt connected to the three dimensional space around me. If I had continued studying math, I would have chosen to study the shape of the universe in a heartbeat. (someone quote this sentence when I get a PhD please) </p>
  <p>I'm terrified of loneliness. I'm even more terrified of realizing I'm alone this entire time. My biggest fear is to have the world closing in on me, and as I back into a wall, I look back and discover there is nothing there. This is exactly what happened when Enrico disappeared on me. I will continue to be paralyzed by fear unless I learn to sit with my emotions, now that I've had my worst nightmware realized. I can try to hide it, numb myself with over stretching my social bandwidth or downloading bumble, all in an effort to convince myself that I'm likeable and socialable and lovable. But I know this is exactly what fear feeds on, the fake happiness, and it will haunt me forever. Out of a desire to reconcile with myself, I want to learn to sit with myself.</p>
  <p>I told my therapist that sitting with my younger self at times felt like pure torture, that I was in so much pain that I didn't know what to do. I really dislike not being in control, especially when it involves pain, and I can't "do" my way to "normal". I know the pain is a part of the process, and I wanted motivation to not numb myself. Instead of giving me motivation, he asked me what my 5 year old self would say to me when she sees that I show up. My knee jerk reaction was, "why the fuck did it take you 20 years to come here," but if I listen closer, I don't hear it coming from my 5 year old self. My 5 year old self is totally chill, unconditionally accepts me for who I am, and is just happy to see me because someone will hold her hand now. The moment she sees me, she is off to the grandest adventure: looking at a daddy long leg crossing the forest floor, taking a nap under the whispering leaves, jumping up and down rocks because she has endless energy. I'd choose to hang out with her any second of the day. Who gives a fuck how many degrees I have, what career advancements I've made, what impressive things I've said or done. She is the person who would take me in no matter how beat up and disheveled I am from the grind of the outside world. </p>
  <p>I have asked every possible friend with time and ears (thank you for listening) what they thought about being alone. The answers were inspiring. There's an idiom in Chinese about bachelor(ette)s: if one person is full, the entire family is full (一人吃饱，全家不饿). I knew it was what people said, but I didn't know what it meant in practice, until one wise friend said, "think about how much thought you're putting into what to text Enrico." I had noticed that this thought had taken up a lot of my headspace, and I often felt resentful that I had to put in the effort, but the beauty of my friend's comment was making me realize that I had a choice in what to do with my thought. It's a choice I'm making in how I want to show up for other people. It shouldn't be based on merely expecting the other person to do it in return, becuase then my intentions aren't pure, and I really could just take out the middle step of "wanting empathy from another person" and replace it with "I want to empathize with myself." I want to be the person who listens to others and empathize with them, because it's something that has helped me grow tremendously over the last few years, but more imporantly now, I want to show myself that I can empathize with myself first. (also another underlying reason is I felt like I was such a shitty person to my friends in middle school becase I hadn't learned how to speak in a way that was considerate of their feelings, and I really hurt their feelings at the time, and I have to make up for it now by doing extra.) Another friend came in with a hot take today: words are just words. When I asked him why, he gave an example: think of something really mean that was said to you that you could not recover from. I actually spent a solid minute thinking, and I did think of some mean things that people have said to me, and I realized my friend was right, I recovered from those, because words are just words, and other people's words don't define me. I define me.</p>
  <p> I had always thought that words are more than words, because you can build bridges and burn bridges, create understanding and misunderstandings, and I followed the mantra of "people won't remember what you said, but they will remember what you made them feel" almost religiously. Maybe the truth lies somehwere in between (quote from another wise friend). </p>




  <div class="section" id="2024/01/28"> 2024/01/28 岁月静好 </div>
  <p>I finally feel alive again. I'm back to my normal workload, which explains why I feel so exhausted every night. I'm grateful for the chance to sleep soundly. </p>
  <p>To give you an idea of what I did this week: 2 therapy sessions, climbing, choir, calling friends, climbing outdoors, meanwhile working a 40 hour week, and cooking, eating, cleaning, journaling, reflecting, calling my parents. Apparently, I numb myself using work. Considering that I don't do drugs or alcohol, I take this as an acceptable for of numbing. Anxiety is fine when I can keep myself alive. </p>
  <p>Now that I am in a safe place, and I'm starting to put different pieces of my life in order, I wonder if I want to give this restlessness reign over my life like I used to. My therapist pointed out that I was judging myself for feeling lazy the week before, when I didn't "do much." In reality, I did tremendous amount of work, taking one day at a time, being with myself as time slowed down to the point where miliseconds felt like hours.</p>
  <p>It's no news that I have a hard time giving credit to myself. I've lived like this all my life. I "do" my way through tough situations to avoid "feel." Though I don't explicitly remember this, I can easily imagine my 5-year-old self thinking, "if I were good enough, my mom would come pick me up today." (For those of you who don't know, I went to boarding kindergarten for a year. I did not enjoy it as much as my parents told themselves I did. It's a can of worms we carefully avoid going near as a family.) Then I guess it also makes sense that I go for emotionally unavailable people, because I can avoid dealing with my own emotions, trying to prove my worth by winning affection that would never come, and putting myself in the familiar situation of emotional neglect. I don't have much, but in the situation, at least I have something that I know with certainty. </p>
  <p>I don't want to live like this anymore. I hope neuroplasticity will kick into high gear and help me get through this behavior pattern. My therapist laughed (in the kindest way) when I said this. This is not an intellectual exercise. I have to feel, to be, to live with my heart. It takes more time and energy than I expect. Peace cannot be "found." I have to create my own peace. </p>
  <p> Maybe I can give myself more credit for taking care of myself. I'm starting to get a bit obsessed with the idea of holding space for myself. I noticed it because my therapist makes me want to discover parts of my brain and my heart that I would not even show the people closest to me, the parts that often I don't even know I'm hiding. Something that I started doing today (let's see how long it lasts): every time I think about Enrico, I have to ask myself why I feel like I have the urge to talk and text him. Aside from wanting to share my life with someone I like, I've disocvered that I actually want to be seen and acknowledged for the things I'm doing for myself. It feels like a roundabout way of going about holding space, but so far I have learned a lot about what emotions are present. </p>
  <p>I didn't make it 21 days of not texting Enrico. I texted him earlier in the week, and we ended up having a conversation. He said he'll just listen and not talk about himself or us. Even then, he kept trying to tell me what to do. Funny how I never noticed these things before, like how I had to be so careful with wording when texting him. This was the closure I needed. I asked him if he missed me. He said sometimes he thinks about me. Voila, how different that I think about him all the time. Memories of him and expectations of what he should do are like the splinters from the chestnuts that I got from bushwhacking yesterday. They go unnoticed when they first enter and while I was having fun, but back after a shower and a day they are festering under my skin, and the pain makes it impossible to stop thinking about them. I don't know how I'll ever have the courage to let someone into my world again, if these are the consequences. </p>
  <p>But Valentine's day is around the corner. I think I'm scared every year if I have to spend that day alone. Friday, while on my way to pick up a crashpad for climbing the next day, I saw a couple walking, and the girl had flowers. I got emotional, with such a strong feeling that I couldn't name. I really wanted to be next to the person that would buy me flowers every week and take me out to dinner every week. Someone to celebrate the small and big moments of life with, eat egg tarts with, go all over the world with. Someone who would make me food. Someone who thinks I'm the most special person in the world, and wouldn't do anything to make me sacrifice what I love or betray myself. I started crying, and at first I thought they were tears of sadness that this person wasn't here, but then realized maybe those were happy tears -- happy that I had this vision. Maybe those were tears of longing, longing for a romance so romantic that even Jane Austen could not pen it. I remembered what one of my high school librarians shared with me. In the hazy and foggy dawn, her husband would pick a fresh magnolia flower from their garden, in full bloom in May (Richmond VA weather), put it into a bowl with water, and bring it into their bedroom so that the smell would fill the room when she wakes up. </p>
  <p>Maybe I have to accept that I will be completely alone on Valentine's day, but I have memories of romantic things that people have told me, and imagine even more romantic things that my future partner will do for me, whilst taking care of myself. Last year, I was at a concert with friends, a very peaceful classical music concert. I drifted into sleep because it was so peaceful and I was so sleep deprived from preparing for three different competitions, doing onsite interviews, traveling, and hooking up with random guys. There were guys that were harder to let go of than others, but I did it anyway. Maybe being alone on Valentine's day isn't the worst experience ever :)</p>


  <div class="section" id="2024/01/21">2024/01/21 </div>
  <p>  If last week was surviving a trial given by the sky (劫后余生), then this week is awakening from a slumber (如梦初醒).</p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and realized that I can reach out to friends and family and admit that my trauma is more than I know how to deal with. The important ones stayed and listened and offered support. I shared with friends what I had written on this page, and they texted me things like "It's okay to open yourself up to love and ask for what you need." "I'm always here for you." I asked friends if they would be willing to be on my safety plan, they said yes without questions and told me times when they know they cannot be avaialble, and checked to see if I was ok with that. I asked friends to help me find emergency numbers in Italy, and help me translate what I need to say in Italian. This brings me warm and fuzzy feelings, like I can curl up in my bed, and my bed is the softest and plushiest bed in the whole world, and that even if far away, friends and family are there for me. I called my mom on average for an hour a day, which never happened since I moved away from home. This is how I wished I could call her when I was little, and I'm surprised that now she answers every time and listens every time, instead of telling me to be strong until she picks me up.  </p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and learned that self-love is love too. Taking it one day at a time was really all that I could do. Looking back, I liked waking up each day and realizing today felt better than yesterday, even if the moment between slumber and wakefulness made me doubt it. When I got out of bed and put clothes on, I knew I was in a different stage. My biggest complaint to myself this week was how my food tasted like shit compared to what I can usually cook, and I could not help but think, love really is my magic ingredient that makes food taste good. Later this week, I realized I can decide to make my food taste good with the love I have for myself. I also noticed how I have a hard time accepting myself for my trauma. I still wish it never happened. I feel broken, I feel like I can never be perfect, I feel like I will forever be despised. No one is telling me any of those things. I am working on reconciling with myself, accepting that I can be imperfect, that I make mistakes, that there are hurdles that I fall when I first try to cross. I won't give up trying to be the best I can. I also won't give up trying to let go and make peace with myself. </p>
  <p>I woke up from the dream of wanting someone to love me. This entire time, 5 months in total, I had lied to myself that if I tried hard enough to be the perfect girlfriend material, Enrico would like me back and care for me the way I needed to be cared for. I ignored every single red flag waving in my face, and thought that relationships are about compromises, and these are the things I have to accept to continue seeing him. I can go on about the terrible things he did in the relationship and postulate all the possibility of silence during a time when I most needed support, but that would not bring me peace. I just wish I can stop thinking about him, once and for all. The awakening came when I realized I am free forever from his expectation of me. </p>
    <p>I am doing a nightly check in of "I didn't text him today" with a friend of mine. I need to hold myself accountable and remember what his actions mean. Herewith I present the wise words of my friend:
      <br>"You can't trust him when he's not there for you when you need him the most"
      <br>"You deserve so much better than what he can offer"
      <br>"It's easy to forget the bad things when you really like someone"
      <br>"What a selfish prick"
      <br>"You can find someone much much better trust me"
      <br> We are at day 5 now. I heard it takes 21 days to build a habit. I'm learning to give up the hope that magically, one day, his text of "sorry I wasn't there for you, I want to make things right" will arrive in my inbox. I don't need to give myself hope and let myself down again. I feel liberated that I don't have to be his provider of sex or free apartment when he visits. I believe my friend when she says I can do much better.
  </p>
  <p>I dreamed my frist good dream the other night, a dream I wish I never had to wake up from. I met someone through an acquaintance, and the first time we spoke, we could not stop talking to each other. The way he looked into my eyes, he saw my soul. He looked at me with love, with desire, but not the kind where he wanted to have sex with me. He saw me completely. He had long blond hair. His cheeks are smooth when we kissed. He told me he loved me. When he asked if I wanted to be with him, I hesitated. That's when I knew my concsious brain kicked in. I have turned down every single person who told me they liked me. I thought it was a burden to be with them, because they will immediately withdraw when they find out I'm not the perfect self that they thought I was, or that they would follow me around incessantly and have no actual identity. Never once did I entertain the possibility where the other person was as interesting as me, as supportive as me, as courageous and adventurous and strong and weak and imperfect as me. I wish that was a dream that played out longer, that I had figured out in my dream how to find this person. I guess this is where my concious brain needs to do the work. How to do it, I don't know. May my favorite lines from Bob Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man bid good omen to this endeavour:
  <br> And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
  <br> Down the foggy ruins of time
  <br> Far past the frozen leaves
  <br> The haunted frightened trees
  <br> Out to the windy beach
  <br> Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
  <br> Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
  <br> With one hand waving free
  <br> Silhouetted by the sea
  <br> Circled by the circus sands
  <br> With all memory and fate
  <br> Driven deep beneath the waves
  <br> Let me forget about today until tomorrow</p>
  <p> I am learning to hold space for my emotions. I am learning to be alone and not feel lonely. I'm starting to feel excited for the coming week and the things that I can do to bring joy. </p>
  <p>Oh and if you are the person that I'm meant to be with, even if you are not a dude, don't have blond hair and smooth cheeks, please still tell me you are you :)</p>

  <p>[TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
  <p>This weekend was eventful and dynamic. And to think, this is weekend #2 of 2024. <br>
  I met old friends in Milan yesterday, many of whom are starting new lives. I didn't realize how much I cherished those friendship until I was in their presence again. They have supported me since I first moved to Italy, friendless and unable to speak Italian. They were within the first 100 people I had interacted with. They are open, genuine, honest souls, and have been since the beginning. The older I get, the more I realize those qualities are hard to come by. And to see so many of them in a day, what a lucky person I am.</p>
  <p>Simultaneosuly, there were many challenging moments. I got furious and said mean things to Enrico, and I'm scared we will never speak again. I cried to my mom for two hours. I had a mental breakdown after I came back from a run. Sometimes, things pile up, and emotions get swept under the rug as I go from one checklist to another. The momentary rush of dopamine that comes from completing yet another document in <i>Italy</i> makes me feel invincible, and I forget about the shit I just had to deal with to get here.</p>
  <p> I realized I had more than just PMS to deal with when I started hearing voices in my head again. These voices have been dormant for the last year, thanks to a change of scenery and commitment to thearpy, but today, they unleashed themselves into my brain like the floodgates of hell have been left loose. </p>
    "No one cares about you" <br>
    "You're not worth living" <br>
    "People are better off without you" <br>
    "You're not worthy of love" <br>
    "Why didn't you jump in front of the train yesterday" <br>

  <p> I didn't have enough calm to get the negative self talk to stop, but I had enough awareness to realize this felt like the same mental space I was in during the darkest months of my depression after the rape. I knew I was triggered. It must have been what happened this week. The gynocology exam on Tuesday still gives me shivers, the two gas technicians in my home on Friday increased the feeling of having my space invaded, and the incompetent geometra reminded me of the policemen who looked like they diligently took notes but did jackshit for the investigation.
  </p>

  <p> I noticed myself hyperventilating: in my mind, I started going through all the things I could do to take my own life. I was almost excited for the relief of the voices in my head as a result. (Yes, I had just met people that I love and care about me the day before, and talked to people I love and care about me just 3 hours ago.) </p>
  <p> Something told me that was not a wise thing to do. I emailed my therapist to move up our therapy session to his first availability. I thought back to the emergency plan that I had made years ago, and realized my contacts are out of date. I wanted to reach out to one friend, but felt silly because just last week when we talked, I had shared all the things I was excited for and looking forward to in the new year in a new city, then felt silly for feeling silly. Call it instinct, or my guardian angel whispering in my ear, I ended up texting a friend whom I've openly shared about my depression and discussed mental health.
  <p>
    [Do you have time right now]<br>
    [I'm not doing well]<br>
    [I don't know who to call for help right now]<br>
  </p>
      <p>[Yes you can call me]  </p>

      <p>I was too embarrassed to admit that I wanted to hurt myself. I started crying when I thanked him for picking up. But he didn't ask what was going on.</p>

      "Do you have a glass of water" <br>
      "Ok pour yourself some" <br>
      "Take small sips"<br>
      "Now breathe with me"<br>
      "I'm here with you"<br>
      "One breath in, hold it for a little bit, then breathe out"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath longer"<br>
      "Remember to breathe out too"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath for 3 seconds"<br>
      "Do you want to talk about what's happening, or do you want to just talk about random things"<br>

      <p> He held space for me, and that helped me help myself. I didn't do something that would take away tomorrow's sunrise from me forever. </p>

        <p> I told him I was triggered, and that I was scared to be raped again, because I know there was no way I can survive it again.
        <br> "You will. It'll be hard, but you will find a way."
        <br>I knew he was right. There was hope, and I forgot about it, but he reminded me that I've done hard things before, and that I can do it again.

        <p> I told him I don't want to be haunted by my demons anymore.
          <br> "You don't have to be. You don't have to let them. Don't let your past define you. Don't try to fight them or push them away, because they will come at you in the most unexpected moments, and then you have to deal with many difficult things all at once. Instead, learn to live with them. It's easier when you do that." Even if it takes discpline and practice to do that, I knew he was right. </p>

        <p> My eyes are still puffy and sore from the three hours of tears that I cried. I didn't realize I still had that much tears. I think at some point the tears turned into tears of happiness, that despite the challenges I'm still alive, and there are people around me who will hold space for me in tough moments. I am counting my blessings, and I have counted them to be exactly the number of tears I have shed. </p>

        <p> Recovery from trauma is not linear. 5 years later and I am still actively dealing with it, but this time surrounded by people I love and living the life that I chose. I wanted to share this moment with you, because maybe it will spread and help another trauma survivor remember that we are not alone, even if it feels like it. If you don't have a friend to call, let my friend's words help you grab a glass of water, slow down your quick and shallow breaths, and remember that we are not our demons.</p>
