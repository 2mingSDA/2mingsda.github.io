    <p>2024/01/28 岁月静好 <br>
  <p>I finally feel alive again. I'm back to my normal workload, which explains why I feel so exhausted every night. I'm grateful for the chance to sleep soundly. </p>
  <p>To give you an idea of what I did this week: 2 therapy sessions, climbing, choir, calling friends, climbing outdoors, meanwhile working a 40 hour week, and cooking, eating, cleaning, journaling, reflecting, calling my parents. Apparently, I numb myself using work. Considering that I don't do drugs or alcohol, I take this as an acceptable for of numbing. Anxiety is fine when I can keep myself alive. </p>
  <p>Now that I am in a safe place, and I'm starting to put different pieces of my life in order, I wonder if I want to give this restlessness reign over my life like I used to. My therapist pointed out that I was judging myself for feeling lazy the week before, when I didn't "do much." In reality, I did tremendous amount of work, taking one day at a time, being with myself as time slowed down to the point where miliseconds felt like hours.</p>
  <p>It's no news that I have a hard time giving credit to myself. I've lived like this all my life. I "do" my way through tough situations to avoid "feel." Though I don't explicitly remember this, I can easily imagine my 5-year-old self thinking, "if I were good enough, my mom would come pick me up today." (For those of you who don't know, I went to boarding kindergarten for a year. I did not enjoy it as much as my parents told themselves I did. It's a can of worms we carefully avoid going near as a family.) Then I guess it also makes sense that I go for emotionally unavailable people, because I can avoid dealing with my own emotions, trying to prove my worth by winning affection that would never come, and putting myself in the familiar situation of emotional neglect. I don't have much, but in the situation, at least I have something that I know with certainty. </p>
  <p>I don't want to live like this anymore. I hope neuroplasticity will kick into high gear and help me get through this behavior pattern. My therapist laughed (in the kindest way) when I said this. This is not an intellectual exercise. I have to feel, to be, to live with my heart. It takes more time and energy than I expect. Peace cannot be "found." I have to create my own peace. </p>
  <p> Maybe I can give myself more credit for taking care of myself. I'm starting to get a bit obsessed with the idea of holding space for myself. I noticed it because my therapist makes me want to discover parts of my brain and my heart that I would not even show the people closest to me, the parts that often I don't even know I'm hiding. Something that I started doing today (let's see how long it lasts): every time I think about the guy (you know, the guy), I have to ask myself why I feel like I have the urge to talk and text him. Aside from wanting to share my life with someone I like, I've disocvered that I actually want to be seen and acknowledged for the things I'm doing for myself. It feels like a roundabout way of going about holding space, but so far I have learned a lot about what emotions are present. </p>
  <p>I didn't make it 21 days of not texting the guy. I texted him earlier in the week, and we ended up having a conversation. He said he'll just listen and not talk about himself or us. Even then, he kept trying to tell me what to do. Funny how I never noticed these things before, like how I had to be so careful with wording when texting him. This was the closure I needed. I asked him if he missed me. He said sometimes he thinks about me. Voila, how different that I think about him all the time. Memories of him and expectations of what he should do are like the splinters from the chestnuts that I got from bushwhacking yesterday. They go unnoticed when they first enter and while I was having fun, but back after a shower and a day they are festering under my skin, and the pain makes it impossible to stop thinking about them. I don't know how I'll ever have the courage to let someone into my world again, if these are the consequences. </p>
  <p>But Valentine's day is around the corner. I think I'm scared every year if I have to spend that day alone. Friday, while on my way to pick up a crashpad for climbing the next day, I saw a couple walking, and the girl had flowers. I got emotional, with such a strong feeling that I couldn't name. I really wanted to be next to the person that would buy me flowers every week and take me out to dinner every week. Someone to celebrate the small and big moments of life with, eat egg tarts with, go all over the world with. Someone who would make me food. Someone who thinks I'm the most special person in the world, and wouldn't do anything to make me sacrifice what I love or betray myself. I started crying, and at first I thought they were tears of sadness that this person wasn't here, but then realized maybe those were happy tears -- happy that I had this vision. Maybe those were tears of longing, longing for a romance so romantic that even Jane Austen could not pen it. I remembered what one of my high school librarians shared with me. In the hazy and foggy dawn, her husband would pick a fresh magnolia flower from their garden, in full bloom in May (Richmond VA weather), put it into a bowl with water, and bring it into their bedroom so that the smell would fill the room when she wakes up. </p>
  <p>Maybe I have to accept that I will be completely alone on Valentine's day, but I have memories of romantic things that people have told me, and imagine even more romantic things that my future partner will do for me, whilst taking care of myself. Last year, I was at a concert with friends, a very peaceful classical music concert. I drifted into sleep because it was so peaceful and I was so sleep deprived from preparing for three different competitions, doing onsite interviews, traveling, and hooking up with random guys. There were guys that were harder to let go of than others, but I did it anyway. Maybe being alone on Valentine's day isn't the worst experience ever :)</p>


    
  <p>2024/01/21 <br>
    If last week was surviving a trial given by the sky (劫后余生), then this week is awakening from a slumber (如梦初醒).</p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and realized that I can reach out to friends and family and admit that my trauma is more than I know how to deal with. The important ones stayed and listened and offered support. I shared with friends what I had written on this page, and they texted me things like "It's okay to open yourself up to love and ask for what you need." "I'm always here for you." I asked friends if they would be willing to be on my safety plan, they said yes without questions and told me times when they know they cannot be avaialble, and checked to see if I was ok with that. I asked friends to help me find emergency numbers in Italy, and help me translate what I need to say in Italian. This brings me warm and fuzzy feelings, like I can curl up in my bed, and my bed is the softest and plushiest bed in the whole world, and that even if far away, friends and family are there for me. I called my mom on average for an hour a day, which never happened since I moved away from home. This is how I wished I could call her when I was little, and I'm surprised that now she answers every time and listens every time, instead of telling me to be strong until she picks me up.  </p>
  <p>I woke up for the first time and learned that self-love is love too. Taking it one day at a time was really all that I could do. Looking back, I liked waking up each day and realizing today felt better than yesterday, even if the moment between slumber and wakefulness made me doubt it. When I got out of bed and put clothes on, I knew I was in a different stage. My biggest complaint to myself this week was how my food tasted like shit compared to what I can usually cook, and I could not help but think, love really is my magic ingredient that makes food taste good. Later this week, I realized I can decide to make my food taste good with the love I have for myself. I also noticed how I have a hard time accepting myself for my trauma. I still wish it never happened. I feel broken, I feel like I can never be perfect, I feel like I will forever be despised. No one is telling me any of those things. I am working on reconciling with myself, accepting that I can be imperfect, that I make mistakes, that there are hurdles that I fall when I first try to cross. I won't give up trying to be the best I can. I also won't give up trying to let go and make peace with myself. </p>
  <p>I woke up from the dream of wanting someone to love me. This entire time, 5 months in total, I had lied to myself that if I tried hard enough to be the perfect girlfriend material, the person I liked would like me back and care for me the way I needed to be cared for. I ignored every single red flag waving in my face, and thought that relationships are about compromises, and these are the things I have to accept to continue seeing this person. I can go on about the terrible things he did in the relationship and postulate all the possibility of silence during a time when I most needed support, but that would not bring me peace. I just wish I can stop thinking about him, once and for all. The awakening came when I realized I am free forever from his expectation of me. </p>
    <p>I am doing a nightly check in of "I didn't text him today" with a friend of mine. I need to hold myself accountable and remember what his actions mean. Herewith I present the wise words of my friend:
      <br>"You can't trust him when he's not there for you when you need him the most"
      <br>"You deserve so much better than what he can offer"
      <br>"It's easy to forget the bad things when you really like someone"
      <br>"What a selfish prick"
      <br>"You can find someone much much better trust me"
      <br> We are at day 5 now. I heard it takes 21 days to build a habit. I'm learning to give up the hope that magically, one day, his text of "sorry I wasn't there for you, I want to make things right" will arrive in my inbox. I don't need to give myself hope and let myself down again. I feel liberated that I don't have to be his provider of sex or free apartment when he visits. I believe my friend when she says I can do much better.
  </p>
  <p>I dreamed my frist good dream the other night, a dream I wish I never had to wake up from. I met someone through an acquaintance, and the first time we spoke, we could not stop talking to each other. The way he looked into my eyes, he saw my soul. He looked at me with love, with desire, but not the kind where he wanted to have sex with me. He saw me completely. He had long blond hair. His cheeks are smooth when we kissed. He told me he loved me. When he asked if I wanted to be with him, I hesitated. That's when I knew my concsious brain kicked in. I have turned down every single person who told me they liked me. I thought it was a burden to be with them, because they will immediately withdraw when they find out I'm not the perfect self that they thought I was, or that they would follow me around incessantly and have no actual identity. Never once did I entertain the possibility where the other person was as interesting as me, as supportive as me, as courageous and adventurous and strong and weak and imperfect as me. I wish that was a dream that played out longer, that I had figured out in my dream how to find this person. I guess this is where my concious brain needs to do the work. How to do it, I don't know. May my favorite lines from Bob Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man bid good omen to this endeavour: 
  <br> And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
  <br> Down the foggy ruins of time
  <br> Far past the frozen leaves
  <br> The haunted frightened trees
  <br> Out to the windy beach
  <br> Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
  <br> Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
  <br> With one hand waving free
  <br> Silhouetted by the sea
  <br> Circled by the circus sands
  <br> With all memory and fate
  <br> Driven deep beneath the waves
  <br> Let me forget about today until tomorrow</p>
  <p> I am learning to hold space for my emotions. I am learning to be alone and not feel lonely. I'm starting to feel excited for the coming week and the things that I can do to bring joy. </p>
  <p>Oh and if you are the person that I'm meant to be with, even if you are not a dude, don't have blond hair and smooth cheeks, please still tell me you are you :)</p>



  <p>2024/01/14 <br>
  [TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about my trauma. Proceed with caution.]</p>
  <p>This weekend was eventful and dynamic. And to think, this is weekend #2 of 2024. <br>
  I met old friends in Milan yesterday, many of whom are starting new lives. I didn't realize how much I cherished those friendship until I was in their presence again. They have supported me since I first moved to Italy, friendless and unable to speak Italian. They were within the first 100 people I had interacted with. They are open, genuine, honest souls, and have been since the beginning. The older I get, the more I realize those qualities are hard to come by. And to see so many of them in a day, what a lucky person I am.</p>
  <p>Simultaneosuly, there were many challenging moments. I got furious and said mean things to someone I really care about, and I'm scared we will never speak again. I cried to my mom for two hours. I had a mental breakdown after I came back from a run. Sometimes, things pile up, and emotions get swept under the rug as I go from one checklist to another. The momentary rush of dopamine that comes from completing yet another document in <i>Italy</i> makes me feel invincible, and I forget about the shit I just had to deal with to get here.</p>
  <p> I realized I had more than just PMS to deal with when I started hearing voices in my head again. These voices have been dormant for the last year, thanks to a change of scenery and commitment to thearpy, but today, they unleashed themselves into my brain like the floodgates of hell have been left loose. </p>
    "No one cares about you" <br>
    "You're not worth living" <br>
    "People are better off without you" <br>
    "You're not worthy of love" <br>
    "Why didn't you jump in front of the train yesterday" <br>

  <p> I didn't have enough calm to get the negative self talk to stop, but I had enough awareness to realize this felt like the same mental space I was in during the darkest months of my depression after the rape. I knew I was triggered. It must have been what happened this week. The gynocology exam on Tuesday still gives me shivers, the two gas technicians in my home on Friday increased the feeling of having my space invaded, and the incompetent geometra reminded me of the policemen who looked like they diligently took notes but did jackshit for the investigation.
  </p>

  <p> I noticed myself hyperventilating: in my mind, I started going through all the things I could do to take my own life. I was almost excited for the relief of the voices in my head as a result. (Yes, I had just met people that I love and care about me the day before, and talked to people I love and care about me just 3 hours ago.) </p>
  <p> Something told me that was not a wise thing to do. I emailed my therapist to move up our therapy session to his first availability. I thought back to the emergency plan that I had made years ago, and realized my contacts are out of date. I wanted to reach out to one friend, but felt silly because just last week when we talked, I had shared all the things I was excited for and looking forward to in the new year in a new city, then felt silly for feeling silly. Call it instinct, or my guardian angel whispering in my ear, I ended up texting a friend whom I've openly shared about my depression and discussed mental health.
  <p>
    [Do you have time right now]<br>
    [I'm not doing well]<br>
    [I don't know who to call for help right now]<br>
  </p>
      <p>[Yes you can call me]  </p>

      <p>I was too embarrassed to admit that I wanted to hurt myself. I started crying when I thanked him for picking up. But he didn't ask what was going on.</p>

      "Do you have a glass of water" <br>
      "Ok pour yourself some" <br>
      "Take small sips"<br>
      "Now breathe wth me"<br>
      "I'm here with you"<br>
      "One breath in, hold it for a little bit, then breathe out"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath longer"<br>
      "Remember to breathe out too"<br>
      "Now try to hold your breath for 3 seconds"<br>
      "Do you want to talk about what's happening, or do you want to just talk about random things"<br>

      <p> He held space for me, and that helped me help myself. I didn't do something that would take away tomorrow's sunrise from me forever. </p>

        <p> I told him I was triggered, and that I was scared to be raped again, because I know there was no way I can survive it again.
        <br> "You will. It'll be hard, but you will find a way."
        <br>I knew he was right. There was hope, and I forgot about it, but he reminded me that I've done hard things before, and that I can do it again.

        <p> I told him I don't want to be haunted by my demons anymore.
          <br> "You don't have to be. You don't have to let them. Don't let your past define you. Don't try to fight them or push them away, because they will come at you in the most unexpected moments, and then you have to deal with many difficult things all at once. Instead, learn to live with them. It's easier when you do that." Even if it takes discpline and practice to do that, I knew he was right. </p>

        <p> My eyes are still puffy and sore from the three hours of tears that I cried. I didn't realize I still had that much tears. I think at some point the tears turned into tears of happiness, that despite the challenges I'm still alive, and there are people around me who will hold space for me in tough moments. I am counting my blessings, and I have counted them to be exactly the number of tears I have shed. </p>

        <p> Recovery from trauma is not linear. 5 years later and I am still actively dealing with it, but this time surrounded by people I love and living the life that I chose. I wanted to share this moment with you, because maybe it will spread and help another trauma survivor remember that we are not alone, even if it feels like it. If you don't have a friend to call, let my friend's words help you grab a glass of water, slow down your quick and shallow breaths, and remember that we are not our demons.</p>
