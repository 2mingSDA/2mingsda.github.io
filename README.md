As a part of my graudate certificate in Boston University's Food Studies program, I took a course called "Planning a Food Business." 
The business idea I came up with is to open a food truck for Shanghai breakfast.

I felt really invested in making this as close to reality as possible, so I created a website with all the programming skills I had.
