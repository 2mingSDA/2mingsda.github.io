# ricefam

As a part of my graudate certificate in Boston University's Food Studies program, I took a course called "Planning a Food Business." 
The business idea I came up with is to open a food truck for Shanghai breakfast called RiceFam. 

The name RiceFam comes from the Shanghainese word for rice balls, "FanTuan." Fan means rice, and Tuan can be loosely translated to family--
because when you are with family, you are tight like a clumped clump together ball of rice. 

I felt really invested in making this as close to reality as possible, so I created a website with all the programming skills I had.
I hope you have as much fun browsing and dreaming about this becoming reality as I did.
