<p> I bailed on my 4 day Prague trip after 24 hours there. 狼狈 (lang bei) would very accurately describe my emotional and physical state, and there's no English equivalent. It's a mix of depseration, without any plans, the shock and emptiness inside you'd get after being splashed by a bus next to a puddle at an intersection. </p>
<p> Let's step back in time to just 3 weeks ago, to the moment when I booked the trip: I was facing an imminent possibility of deportation from Italy, or otherwise be stuck in Italy and not be able to exit or re-enter without losing the last two years of being here to count towards permanent residency. Either way, it meant I wouldn't be able to travel in the Schengen zone freely as I do right now. Freaked out is an understatement: my brain was in overdrive simulating all possible worst case scenarios. For whatever reason, my epiphany in that moment was "I am an adventurous person, I will travel to overcome this stress." And where else to go but to Prague, hometown of my favorite author, Kafka? His genius depiction of bureaucracy and the ensuing meaninglessness that prevades every single inch of my life prefectly defines my current mental state, and I wanted to immerse myself in his city. </p>
<p> The minute I stepped outside the airport, I got heebie jeebies. (Why? I'm too paranoid to write this out. Either we've already called and talked about it, or you'd have to ask me to explain to you when we call next.) While at the hostel, I tried for 4 hours to fall asleep, but was tossing and turning and in limbo between wakefulness and sleep the entire time. The light, the noises, the smell of mold, the feeling of loneliness when I'm in the same room with 5 other people, the memories of sleeping at the boarding kindergarten, the memories of staying in hostels with Enrico. I couldn't pin down what was keeping me up, but I was hurting. My soul was hurting. I was travel weary. I didn't want to be there. </p>
<p> The next morning, when I woke up, I called my ex to talk through "should I stay or should I go" (of course we'd be experts at talking about this at this point). Funny that he was the person I turned to in a moment of desperation, especially considering one of our last fights together started out with him saying "you're not that adventurous." But he understood me, saw me clearly, and knew why I was feeling this way. I decided: there were a few things I still wanted to see in Prague, let's see if I want to see more after I hit all these places on my bucket list. </p>
<p> When 10:30 came around and I showed up at the walking tour gathering point that I signed up for, so did 70 other people who had the same idea. Overwhelmed by the organized tourism, I beelined for the Dvorak museum (you can imagine how unusual and unpopular this destination is), and quickly got the idea for what the rest of the museums in the city might be like: pay more than what the shittily curated exhibits deserve. I wasn't disappointed with Dvorak, no; I was inspired by his music, his traveling, his graduation gown (I missed both of my graduations and to this day have not worn a graduation gown... time to go back to school again). But I certainly was disillusioned when I exited the museum. Why the fuck did I need to leave my home, thinking the world out there is better, only to find the same thing everywhere else in the world? I was experiencing the blessing and curse of globalization: humanity is placed inside a petri dish, examined under the microscope, spiced with different external conditions, but all arriving at the same fucked up results in the diversity of cultures we see. But how else could I have arrived at this conclusion for myself if I never left? </p>
<p> I didn't know this at the time of booking the trip: this year is the centenarium (fancy word that I learned that stands for "100th anniversary of a significant event") of Kafka's death. There are pop up exhibits on his life all over Prague and the Czech republic in addition to the Kafka museum permanent exhibits. The only other ongoing exhibit in Prague that coincided with my stay was inside a synagogue, which was closed because of Rosh Hashanah (to this day I have never been inside a synagogue). Instead, I walked past his rotating head next to a mall and went by his statue in the Jewish quarter to get my fully immersive Kafka experience. I briefly wandered past an exhibit named Kafka's world, and laughed out lout when I realized it's an overpriced tourist trap. This is exactly what Kafka would not want his legacy to be... but what do I know? </p>
<p> I saved Kafka's museum as the last thing I did before I got moving. When I came here as a child, I thought to myself, I want to read all of Kafka's books and come back to this museum. Now I've read most of Kafka's books and came back. Bucket list checked off. The only thing left to do was to pay a visit to my friend from college whom I haven't spoken with in 6 years. More on that in the Oct 7 2024 journal entry. It actually ended up being an exceptionally healing experience, on many different levels. </p>
<p> After a delayed flight that I paid too much for, 2 hours of bus, and a e-bike ride, I was finally in my own bed. I felt settled, I felt at home, I was happy that I came back. So what Turin is an ugly, slightly polluted, boring little town? It's my town. I want to give myself time to settle in and grow and thrive, like the new swiss chards and kale that I just transplanted. I'm cancelling the rest of my trips-- Athens and Rome deserve to be carefully planned and studied, rather than a last mintue trip as an anxious effort to escape. </p>

<p>"Turin feels like a 三线城市 (3rd line city, used to refer to non-major cities that are just bigger than villages in China)" I thought to myself as my airport commute wove me back into the overcast city. The buildings remind me of those of my dad's hometown, so uncharming, lackluster, provincial, the same feelings I got every time I visited from Shanghai as a child. Maybe I'm feeling this way because of the fresh return from Copenhagen--just like Shanghai, it is a city built atop a salt marsh, run by merchants, obsessed with consumerism. Being homeless is apparently a punishable offense in the city nowadays, a tradition dating back to the 1800s, when being poor was also a crime. At least the social security works pleasantly well, coming from taxes close to 50% of a pay check. Everyone spoke English, and many other languages besides Danish. Copenhagen has the kind of suffocating hierarchy that spurred me to move in the first place. Everyone has a place to be -- it's like visiting a very well-organized house by Marie Kondo, no excess, no shortage, just right, everything has a reason to occupy the right space at the right time. Even the hippies in Christiania, self proclaimed anarchists, make money off of tourism and get free healthcare. Sign me up to be an anarchist hippie any time if that's what it means.</p>
<p>All the stereotypes of the city are true. Everything cost money--luckily, except for the library. The national library had an exhibit on a few of their artifacts, including the first printed books in Denmark (as much as I hate the overabundance of news nowadays, thank goodness for mass printing and for making knowledge accessible through print), Soren Kierkegaard's diaries, Tycho Brahe's notes, old globes (impressive to see how human understanding of the world has evolved over time). Thank goodness for knowlege, for science. But at what cost? And why do we take science as the end all be all? (I support science, but I think it's given too much credit as a way of explaining the world. It's just one way of understanding the physical world around us). I also feel pessimistic about the future: look at how far we have come, our ancestors had 8000 years of experimentation, and still we haven't figured out a better way than war. I doubt my generation is smart enough to collectively come up with the wisdom to fundamentally alter humanity's tendency to go to war. </p>
<p>Forces of nature are in balance: where there is creation, there is destruction.  Despite all the shit happening in the world right now, time to time I like to remind myself of how far humanity has come. Experiencing art and beauty is one way for me to make space. There is one unassuming painting by van Gogh, on the corner of the French collection at the Glyptotek, of Pont du Carrousel and the Louvre. I was caught off guard, because I felt transported into his mind, in that place, that time, and stood right where he was, and gazed at the scene as it was unfolding. It was such a powerful feeling of presence that I was convinced if someone from the year 200 BC were to stand where van Gogh was, when the painting would have shown a marshy river bank, that person would recognize exactly where the painting was. </p>
<p>I'm happy for the chance to travel, for turning inward, for letting my thoughts flow free, for seeing the world, the people around me, myself, with a slightly different perspective.</p>

<div class="section" id="2024/03/08"> milan 36hrs 2024/03/08 </div>
<p>I had a chance to travel to Milan for work. At the time the opportunity presented itself, my passport has been missing for a month, and I was feeling the cabin fever of being stuck in Turin. I said "why not" and booked train tickets.</p>
<p>I had 36 hours in total. Minus the 8 hours of sleep, 2x8-hour work days, 5 hour work parties, I had a total of 7 hours to myself, to reminisce my days in Milan, and to spend with people I actually wanted to see.</p>
<p>There are always all kinds of people at train stations. Different shapes and sizes, different outfits, luggages and backpacks in all varieties, baggage physical and metaphorical. We traveled for different reasons, maybe to run to joy, to reunite with family, to evade pain, to run away and start a new life, to come back to the same familair place. Regardless of the reason, we were all about to get onto a metal container, moving all atoms in our bodies at 200km/hr. It's a paradoxical moment of stillness and motion. Just like how we are flying at dizzying speeds through the universe at all moments, but we never consider it.</p>
<p>The first time I set foot in Milan, I thought this was meant to be my place. It was the first time I lived on my own. It was the first time I learned to take care of myself by choosing what I wanted to do (go on walks) instead of what I needed to do (go to class). I grew and learned, fell and got back on my feet, felt settled and foreigned at the same time. Now that I've uprooted myself again and grew into the comfort of Turin, I see the pressure that had built up that I ignored, just like the dust that collects at the top of my very tall wardrobe. Life was moving at such high speeds that the only places of stillness were the ones that I conveniently ignored, too tall to reach, until it catches me by surprise when allergy season hits. </p>
<p>I take this as the sunk cost of growing up. At least I learned something more about myself since the last time I was in Milan. I learned who the people are that matter to me the most, and I learned to save time for them.</p>
<p>I leave you with this video of what I saw in Milan, and all the sounds that I heard that told me spring has sprung in Milan.</p>
