<p>"Turin feels like a 三线城市 (3rd line city, used to refer to non-major cities that are just bigger than villages in China)" I thought to myself as my airport commute wove me back into the overcast city. The buildings remind me of those of my dad's hometown, so uncharming, lackluster, provincial, the same feelings I got every time I visited from Shanghai as a child. Maybe I'm feeling this way because of the fresh return from Copenhagen--just like Shanghai, it is a city built atop a salt marsh, run by merchants, obsessed with consumerism. Being homeless is apparently a punishable offense in the city nowadays, a tradition dating back to the 1800s, when being poor was also a crime. At least the social security works pleasantly well, coming from taxes close to 50% of a pay check. Everyone spoke English, and many other languages besides Danish. Copenhagen has the kind of suffocating hierarchy that spurred me to move in the first place. Everyone has a place to be -- it's like visiting a very well-organized house by Marie Kondo, no excess, no shortage, just right, everything has a reason to occupy the right space at the right time. Even the hippies in Christiania, self proclaimed anarchists, make money off of tourism and get free healthcare. Sign me up to be an anarchist hippie any time if that's what it means.</p>
<p>All the stereotypes of the city are true. Everything cost money--luckily, except for the library. The national library had an exhibit on a few of their artifacts, including the first printed books in Denmark (as much as I hate the overabundance of news nowadays, thank goodness for mass printing and for making knowledge accessible through print), Soren Kierkegaard's diaries, Tycho Brahe's notes, old globes (impressive to see how human understanding of the world has evolved over time). Thank goodness for knowlege, for science. But at what cost? And why do we take science as the end all be all? (I support science, but I think it's given too much credit as a way of explaining the world. It's just one way of understanding the physical world around us). I also feel pessimistic about the future: look at how far we have come, our ancestors had 8000 years of experimentation, and still we haven't figured out a better way than war. I doubt my generation is smart enough to collectively come up with the wisdom to fundamentally alter humanity's tendency to go to war. </p>
<p>Forces of nature are in balance: where there is creation, there is destruction.  Despite all the shit happening in the world right now, time to time I like to remind myself of how far humanity has come. Experiencing art and beauty is one way for me to make space. There is one unassuming painting by van Gogh, on the corner of the French collection at the Glyptotek, of Pont du Carrousel and the Louvre. I was caught off guard, because I felt transported into his mind, in that place, that time, and stood right where he was, and gazed at the scene as it was unfolding. It was such a powerful feeling of presence that I was convinced if someone from the year 200 BC were to stand where van Gogh was, when the painting would have shown a marshy river bank, that person would recognize exactly where the painting was. </p>
<p>I'm happy for the chance to travel, for turning inward, for letting my thoughts flow free, for seeing the world, the people around me, myself, with a slightly different perspective.</p>

<p>I had a chance to travel to Milan for work. At the time the opportunity presented itself, my passport has been missing for a month, and I was feeling the cabin fever of being stuck in Turin. I said "why not" and booked train tickets.</p>
<p>I had 36 hours in total. Minus the 8 hours of sleep, 2x8-hour work days, 5 hour work parties, I had a total of 7 hours to myself, to reminisce my days in Milan, and to spend with people I actually wanted to see.</p>
<p>There are always all kinds of people at train stations. Different shapes and sizes, different outfits, luggages and backpacks in all varieties, baggage physical and metaphorical. We traveled for different reasons, maybe to run to joy, to reunite with family, to evade pain, to run away and start a new life, to come back to the same familair place. Regardless of the reason, we were all about to get onto a metal container, moving all atoms in our bodies at 200km/hr. It's a paradoxical moment of stillness and motion. Just like how we are flying at dizzying speeds through the universe at all moments, but we never consider it.</p>
<p>The first time I set foot in Milan, I thought this was meant to be my place. It was the first time I lived on my own. It was the first time I learned to take care of myself by choosing what I wanted to do (go on walks) instead of what I needed to do (go to class). I grew and learned, fell and got back on my feet, felt settled and foreigned at the same time. Now that I've uprooted myself again and grew into the comfort of Turin, I see the pressure that had built up that I ignored, just like the dust that collects at the top of my very tall wardrobe. Life was moving at such high speeds that the only places of stillness were the ones that I conveniently ignored, too tall to reach, until it catches me by surprise when allergy season hits. </p>
<p>I take this as the sunk cost of growing up. At least I learned something more about myself since the last time I was in Milan. I learned who the people are that matter to me the most, and I learned to save time for them.</p>
<p>I leave you with this video of what I saw in Milan, and all the sounds that I heard that told me spring has sprung in Milan.</p>
