<p>I had a chance to travel to Milan for work. At the time the opportunity presented itself, my passport has been missing for a month, and I was feeling the cabin fever of being stuck in Turin. I said "why not" and booked train tickets.</p>
<p>I had 36 hours in total. Minus the 8 hours of sleep, 2x8-hour work days, 5 hour work parties, I had a total of 7 hours to myself, to reminisce my days in Milan, and to spend with people I actually wanted to see.</p>
<p>There are always all kinds of people at train stations. Different shapes and sizes, different outfits, luggages and backpacks in all varieties, baggage physical and metaphorical. We traveled for different reasons, maybe to run to joy, to reunite with family, to evade pain, to run away and start a new life, to come back to the same familair place. Regardless of the reason, we were all about to get onto a metal container, moving all atoms in our bodies at 200km/hr. It's a paradoxical moment of stillness and motion. Just like how we are flying at dizzying speeds through the universe at all moments, but we never consider it.</p>
<p>The first time I set foot in Milan, I thought this was meant to be my place. It was the first time I lived on my own. It was the first time I learned to take care of myself by choosing what I wanted to do (go on walks) instead of what I needed to do (go to class). I grew and learned, fell and got back on my feet, felt settled and foreigned at the same time. Now that I've uprooted myself again and grew into the comfort of Turin, I see the pressure that had built up that I ignored, just like the dust that collects at the top of my very tall wardrobe. Life was moving at such high speeds that the only places of stillness were the ones that I conveniently ignored, too tall to reach, until it catches me by surprise when allergy season hits. </p>
<p>I take this as the sunk cost of growing up. At least I learned something more about myself since the last time I was in Milan. I learned who the people are that matter to me the most, and I learned to save time for them.</p>
<p>I leave you with this video of what I saw in Milan, and all the sounds that I heard that told me spring has sprung in Milan.</p>
